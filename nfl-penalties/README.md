# NFL Penalties üèà
Data on NFL penalties from 2009-2018 (as found on [nflpenalties.com](https://www.nflpenalties.com/)).

### Data
There are two separate data files, both excel workbooks, data from 2009-2018 (located in the `data` folder).
1. `by_team_group.xlsx`: penalties per phase of the game (Offense/Defense/Special Teams), per team, per year. Each sheet contains a different year.
    * `Total/Off/Def/ST Ct` - number of penalties
    * `Total/Off/Def/ST Yds` - penalty yardage
    * `Off/Def/ST Presnap` - number of penalties pre-snap
2. `by_penalty.xlsx`: data on 39 specific penalties, per team, per year. Each sheet contains a different penalty. Data for '09-'18 is stacked in each sheet.
    * Each sheet contains
        * `Games` - num games played (includes post season)
        * `Count` - total num penalties committed
        * `Yards Lost` - true yards lost
        * `Dismissed` - num penalties dismissed by opponent
        * `Home` - num penalties home

        * *Note - `Penalty_Outcome` for a few penalties were purposely populated with odd values, as follows*
            * Spot fouls (penalty yardage determined by the spot of the foul): 
                * `defensive-pass-interference` &`illegal-touch-kick`. 
                * Given `Penalty_Outcome = 111`
            * Penalties whose yards differ whether they're committed by the defense or the offense OR penalties whose yards depend on the situation: 
                * `intentional-grounding` & `illegal-use-of-hands`. 
                * Given `Penalty_Outcome = 999`
