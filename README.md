# Jeremy Field's Data Science Portfolio

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks & side projects I've created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms. You can find stand-alone projects at the top.

## Stand-alone 

### Favoritify
Not Data Science in the traditional sense (honestly more of a front-end project) but I created this React app, [Favoritify](https://favoritify.herokuapp.com/), that polls the Spotify API for a user's top music and displays a personalized dashboard of visualizations. Includes top tracks/genres/artists, how popular they are globally on average, the typical auditory features of your music, and more. Honestly, it's pretty sweet. [Code here](https://github.com/delafields/Favoritify). *Not being monitored - if broken please send me a note. All that being said, please give it a try!*

## Data Visualizations
Follow the link [here](https://github.com/delafields/data_visualizations) here for my repo of some data viz projects.

    * [My Jump Scares viz](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/dei68x/battle_dataviz_battle_for_the_month_of_october/f3vp452/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) that won the October r/dataisbeautiful [competition](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/drgz68/battle_dataviz_battle_for_the_month_of_november/).

## Data exploration and analysis

## Problem-based

## Kaggle competitions

## Kaggle kernels

### Categorical Feature Encoding Challenge
This challenge involved taking a data set *solely* comprised of categorical features and encoding them in a way that captured as much useful signal as possible. Ingested data included binary features, nominal and ordinal features (of varying cardinality) and cyclical features. In this [kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/delafields/a-thorough-guide-on-categorical-feature-encoding) I implemented a thorough range of encoding techniques including feature hashing, likelihood encoding, and sin/cos transforms.

### Tinker, Tailor, Scientist, Analyst
[This kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/delafields/tinker-tailor-scientist-analyst), exploratory in nature, sought to provide contextual evidence to the often asked "What's the difference between a Data Scientist and a Data Analyst?". The dataset used to compile this kernel was [Kaggle's 2019 ML & DS Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/c/kaggle-survey-2019), narrowed down to those who identified as either Analysts or Scientists. Through looking at various Demographic questions, Career questions (like education level, work roles, salary), and Tooling Used (favorite algorithms, ML frameworks, langs) - I discovered some lines of separation between the two titles. *TLDR - years of experience, education, and consequentially, salary.*
