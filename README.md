# Jeremy Field's Data Science Portfolio

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks & side projects I've created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms. You can find stand-alone projects at the top.

## Stand-alone 

### Favoritify
Not Data Science in the traditional sense (honestly more of a front-end project) but I created this React app, [Favoritify](https://favoritify.herokuapp.com/), that polls the Spotify API for a user's top music and displays a personalized dashboard of visualizations. Includes top tracks/genres/artists, how popular they are globally on average, the typical auditory features of your music, and more. Honestly, it's pretty sweet. [Code here](https://github.com/delafields/Favoritify).

## Kaggle competitions

## Kaggle kernels

### Categorical Feature Encoding Challenge
This challenge involved taking a data set *solely* comprised of categorical features and encoding them in a way that captured as much useful signal as possible. Ingested data included binary features, nominal and ordinal features (of varying cardinality) and cyclical features. In this [kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/delafields/a-thorough-guide-on-categorical-feature-encoding) I implemented a thorough range of encoding techniques including feature hashing, likelihood encoding, and sin/cos transforms.
