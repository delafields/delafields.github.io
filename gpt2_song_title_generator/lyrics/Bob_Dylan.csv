Murder Most Foul,"'Twas a dark day in Dallas, November '63
A day that will live on in infamy
President Kennedy was a-ridin' high
Good day to be livin' and a good day to die
Being led to the slaughter like a sacrificial lamb
He said, ""Wait a minute, boys, you know who I am?""
""Of course we do, we know who you are""
Then they blew off his head while he was still in the car
Shot down like a dog in broad daylight
Was a matter of timing and the timing was right
You got unpaid debts, we've come to collect
We're gonna kill you with hatred, without any respect
We'll mock you and shock you and we'll grin in your face
We've already got someone here to take your place
The day they blew out the brains of the king
Thousands were watching, no one saw a thing
It happened so quickly, so quick, by surprise
Right there in front of everyone's eyes
Greatest magic trick ever under the sun
Perfectly executed, skillfully done
Wolfman, oh Wolfman, oh Wolfman, howl
Rub-a-dub-dub, it's a murder most foul

Hush, little children, you'll understand
The Beatles are comin', they're gonna hold your hand
Slide down the banister, go get your coat
Ferry 'cross the Mersey and go for the throat
There's three bums comin' all dressed in rags
Pick up the pieces and lower the flags
I'm goin' to Woodstock, it's the Aquarian Age
Then I'll go over to Altamont and sit near the stage
Put your head out the window, let the good times roll
There's a party going on behind the Grassy Knoll
Stack up the bricks, pour the cement
Don't say Dallas don't love you, Mr. President
Put your foot in the tank and then step on the gas
Try to make it to the triple underpass
Blackface singer, whiteface clown
Better not show your faces after the sun goes down
Up in the red light district, like a cop on the beat
Living in a nightmare on Elm Street
When you're down on Deep Ellum, put your money in your shoe
Don't ask what your country can do for you
Cash on the barrelhead, money to burn
Dealey Plaza, make a left-hand turn
I'm going down to the crossroads, gonna flag a ride
The place where faith, hope, and charity died
Shoot him while he runs, boy, shoot him while you can
See if you can shoot the invisible man
Goodbye, Charlie, goodbye, Uncle Sam
Frankly, Miss Scarlett, I don't give a damn
What is the truth, and where did it go?
Ask Oswald and Ruby, they oughta know
""Shut your mouth,"" said a wise old owl
Business is business, and it's a murder most foul
Tommy, can you hear me? I'm the Acid Queen
I'm riding in a long, black Lincoln limousine
Ridin' in the back seat next to my wife
Headed straight on in to the afterlife
I'm leaning to the left, I got my head in her lap
Oh Lord, I've been led into some kind of a trap
Where we ask no quarter, and no quarter do we give
We're right down the street, from the street where you live
They mutilated his body and they took out his brain
What more could they do? They piled on the pain
But his soul was not there where it was supposed to be at
For the last fifty years they've been searchin' for that
Freedom, oh freedom, freedom over me
I hate to tell you, mister, but only dead men are free
Send me some lovin', then tell me no lie
Throw the gun in the gutter and walk on by
Wake up, little Susie, let's go for a drive
Cross the Trinity River, let's keep hope alive
Turn the radio on, don't touch the dials
Parkland Hospital, only six more miles
You got me dizzy, Miss Lizzy, you filled me with lead
That magic bullet of yours has gone to my head
I'm just a patsy like Patsy Cline
Never shot anyone from in front or behind
I've blood in my eye, got blood in my ear
I'm never gonna make it to the new frontier
Zapruder's film, I've seen that before
Seen it thirty-three times, maybe more
It's vile and deceitful, it's cruel and it's mean
Ugliest thing that you ever have seen
They killed him once and they killed him twice
Killed him like a human sacrifice
The day that they killed him, someone said to me, ""Son
The age of the Antichrist has just only begun""
Air Force One comin' in through the gate
Johnson sworn in at 2:38
Let me know when you decide to throw in the towel
It is what it is, and it's murder most foul
What's new, pussycat? What'd I say?
I said the soul of a nation been torn away
And it's beginning to go into a slow decay
And that it's thirty-six hours past Judgment Day
Wolfman Jack, he's speaking in tongues
He's going on and on at the top of his lungs
Play me a song, Mr. Wolfman Jack
Play it for me in my long Cadillac
Play me that ""Only the Good Die Young""
Take me to the place Tom Dooley was hung
Play ""St. James Infirmary"" in the Court of King James
If you want to remember, you better write down the names
Play Etta James, too, play ""I'd Rather Go Blind""
Play it for the man with the telepathic mind

Play it for that strip club owner named Jack

Play ""Please Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood""
Play it for the First Lady, she ain't feeling any good
Play Don Henley, play Glenn Frey
Take it to the limit and let it go by
Play it for Carl Wilson, too
Looking far, far away down Gower Avenue
Play ""Tragedy"", play ""Twilight Time""
Take me back to Tulsa to the scene of the crime
Play another one and ""Another One Bites the Dust""
Play ""The Old Rugged Cross"" and ""In God We Trust""
Ride the pink horse down that long, lonesome road
Stand there and wait for his head to explode
Play ""Mystery Train"" for Mr. Mystery
The man who fell down dead like a rootless tree
Play it for the reverend, play it for the pastor
Play it for the dog that got no master
Play Oscar Peterson, play Stan Getz
Play ""Blue Sky,"" play Dickey Betts
Play Art Pepper, Thelonious Monk
Charlie Parker and all that junk
All that junk and ""All That Jazz""
Play something for the Birdman of Alcatraz
Play Buster Keaton, play Harold Lloyd

Play Number nine, play Number six
Play it for Lindsey and Stevie Nicks
Play Nat King Cole, play ""Nature Boy""
Play ""Down in the Boondocks"" for Terry Malloy
Play ""It Happened One Night"" and ""One Night of Sin""
There's twelve million souls that are listening in
Play ""Merchant of Venice"", play ""Merchants of Death""
Play ""Stella by Starlight"" for Lady Macbeth
Don't worry, Mr. President, help's on the way
Your brothers are comin', there'll be hell to pay
Brothers? What brothers? What's this about hell?
Tell them, ""We're waiting, keep coming,"" we'll get them as well
Love Field is where his plane touched down
But it never did get back up off the ground
Was a hard act to follow, second to none
They killed him on the altar of the rising sun
Play ""Misty"" for me and ""That Old Devil Moon""
Play ""Anything Goes"" and ""Memphis in June""
Play ""Lonely at the Top"" and ""Lonely Are the Brave""
Play it for Houdini spinning around in his grave
Play Jelly Roll Morton, play ""Lucille""
Play ""Deep in a Dream"", and play ""Driving Wheel""
Play ""Moonlight Sonata"" in F-sharp
And ""A Key to the Highway"" for the king on the harp
Play ""Marching Through Georgia"" and ""Dumbarton's Drums""
Play ""Darkness"" and death will come when it comes
Play ""Love Me or Leave Me"" by the great Bud Powell
Play ""The Blood-Stained Banner"", play ""Murder Most Foul""36EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Blowin’ in the Wind,"How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
How many seas must the white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Yes, and how many times must the cannonballs fly
Before they're forever banned?

The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

Yes, and how many years can a mountain exist
'Fore it is washed to the sea?
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
And pretend that he just doesn't see?

The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

Yes, and how many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
That too many people have died?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind44EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
The Times They Are A-Changin’,"Come gather 'round people, wherever you roam
And admit that the waters around you have grown
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you is worth saving
Then you better start swimmin' or you'll sink like a stone
For the times, they are a-changin'
Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide, the chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon, for the wheel's still in spin
And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'
For the loser now will be later to win
For the times, they are a-changin'
Come senators, congressmen, please heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
The battle outside ragin'
Will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
For the times, they are a-changin'
Come mothers and fathers throughout the land
And don't criticize what you can't understand
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly aging
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
For the times, they are a-changin'
The line, it is drawn, the curse, it is cast
The slow one now will later be fast
As the present now will later be past
The order is rapidly fading
And the first one now will later be last
For the times, they are a-changin'38EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
All Along the Watchtower,"""There must be some way out of here""
Said the joker to the thief
""There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Businessmen, they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line
Know what any of it is worth""

""No reason to get excited""
The thief, he kindly spoke
""There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour is getting late""

All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Outside, in the distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
The wind began to howl42EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Like a Rolling Stone,"Once upon a time you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People call, say ""Beware doll, you're bound to fall""
You thought they were all a-kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be without a home?
Like a complete unknown?
Like a rolling stone?

Aw, you've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But ya know ya only used to get juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught ya how to live out on the street
And now you’re gonna have to get used to it
You say you never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, “Do you want to make a deal?""
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?

Aw, you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you
Never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal?

How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To hang on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?
Aw, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchangin' all precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring, ya better pawn it, babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls ya, ya can't refuse
When ya ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose
You're invisible now, ya got no secrets to conceal
How does it feel?
Aw, how does it feel?
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?61EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Make You Feel My Love,"When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven’t made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I’ve known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

I’d go hungry, I’d go black and blue
I’d go crawling down the avenue
There’s nothing that I wouldn’t do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn’t do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Hurricane,"Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
Cries out, “My God, they killed them all!”

Here comes the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For something that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world

Three bodies lyin' there
Does Patty see
And another man named Bello
Moving around mysteriously
“I didn’t do it,” he says
And he throws up his hands
“I was only robbin' the register
I hope you understand

I saw them leaving,” he says, and he stops
“One of us had better call up the cops”
And so Patty calls the cops
And they arrive on the scene
With their red lights flashin'
In the hot New Jersey night
Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down

When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
Just like the time before and the time before that
In Paterson that’s just the way things go
If you’re black
You might as well not show up on the street
Unless you want to draw the heat

Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around
He said, “I saw two men running out
They looked like middleweights
They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates”

And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
Cop said, “Wait a minute, boys, this one’s not dead”
So they took him to the infirmary
And though this man could hardly see
They told him that he could identify the guilty men
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in
They take him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs
The wounded man looks up through his one dying eye
Says, “Why did you bring him in here for?
He ain't the guy!”

Here’s the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For something that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world

Four months later, the ghettos are in flame
Rubin’s in South America, fighting for his name
While Arthur Dexter Bradley’s still in the robbery game
And the cops are putting the screws to him
Lookin' for somebody to blame

“Remember that murder that happened in a bar?”
“Remember you said you saw the getaway car?”
“You think you’d like to play ball with the law?”
“Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw
Running that night?”
“Don’t forget that you are white”
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, “I’m really not sure”
The cops said, “A poor boy like you could use a break
We got you for the motel job
And we’re talking to your friend Bello
Now you don’t want to have to go back to jail
Be a nice fellow

You’ll be doing society a favor
That son of a bitch is brave and gettin' braver
We want to put his ass in stir
We want to pin this triple murder
On him
He ain’t no Gentleman Jim”

Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
But he never did like to talk about it all that much
""It’s my work"", he’d say, ""and I do it for pay
And when it’s over I’d just as soon go on my way""

Up to some paradise
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And ride a horse along a trail
But then they took him to the jailhouse
Where they try to turn a man
Into a mouse

All of Rubin’s cards were marked in advance
The trial was a pig-circus
He never had a chance
The judge made Rubin’s witnesses
Drunkards from the slums
To the white folks who watched
He was a revolutionary bum

And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigga
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger
And though they could not produce the gun
The D.A. said he was the one
Who did the deed
And the all-white jury agreed

Rubin Carter was falsely tried
The crime was murder “one,”
Guess who testified?
Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride

How can the life of such a man
Be in the palm of some fool’s hand?
To see him obviously framed
Couldn’t help but make me feel ashamed
To live in a land
Where justice is a game

Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Are free to drink Martinis
And watch the sun rise
While Rubin sits like Buddha
In a ten-foot cell
An innocent man in a living hell

Yes that’s the story of the Hurricane
But it won’t be over till they clear his name
And give him back the time he’s done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world24EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
"Don’t Think Twice, It’s All Right","Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If'n you don't know by now
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It'll never do somehow
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on
But don't think twice, it's all right

And it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe
The light I never knowed
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
But I wish there was something you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
But we never did too much talking anyway
But don't think twice, it's all right

So it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
Like you never done before
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal
I can't hear you anymore
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking down the road
I once loved a woman, a child, I'm told
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don't think twice, it's all right
So long, honey babe
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
Goodbye's too good a word, babe
So I'll just say, ""Fare thee well""
I ain't a-saying you treated me unkind
You could've done better, but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don't think twice, it's all right25EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Mr. Tambourine Man,"Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you

Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand
Vanished from my hand
Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping
My weariness amazes me, I am branded on my feet
I have no one to meet
And my ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming

Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you

Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship
My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip
My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels
To be wandering
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade, cast your dancin' spell my way
I promise to go under it
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you

Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun
It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escaping on the run
And but for the sky there are no fences facing
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind
I wouldn't pay it any mind
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing

Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you

And take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle mornin' I'll come followin' you22EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
A Hard Rain’s A-Gonna Fall,"Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
And where have you been, my darling young one?
I’ve stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
I’ve walked and I’ve crawled on six crooked highways
I’ve stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
I’ve been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
I’ve been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard

And it’s a hard, and it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard
It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall

Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleeding
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten-thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children

And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, and it’s a hard
It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall
And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazing
I heard ten-thousand whispering and nobody listening
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing
I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley

And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard
It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall

Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
And who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog
I met a young woman, her body was burning
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
I met one man who was wounded in love
I met another man who was wounded in hatred

And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard
It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall
And what will you do now, my blue-eyed son?
And what will you do now, my darling young one?
I’m a-going back out ’fore the rain starts a-falling
I’ll walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
And the executioner’s face is always well hidden
Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten
Where black is the color, where none is the number
And I’ll tell it, and speak it, and think it, and breathe it
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it
Then I’ll stand on the ocean until I start sinking
But I’ll know my song well before I start singing

And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, and it’s a hard
It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall24EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Subterranean Homesick Blues,"Johnny's in the basement, mixin' up the medicine
I'm on the pavement, thinkin' about the government
The man in a trench coat, badge out, laid off
Says he's got a bad cough, wants to get it paid off
Look out kid, it's somethin' you did
God knows when, but you're doin' it again
You better duck down the alleyway, looking for a new friend
The man in the coon-skin cap in a pig pen
Wants 11 dollar bills – you only got 10

Maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot
Talkin' that the heat put plants in the bed, but
Phone's tapped anyway
Maggie says the many say
They must bust in early May
Orders from the D.A
Look out kid, don't matter what you did
Walk on your tip toes, don’t tie no bows
Better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose, watch the plainclothes
You don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows

Oh, get sick, get well, hang around a ink well
Hang bail, hard to tell if anything is gonna sell
Try hard, get barred, get back, ride rail
Get jailed, jump bail, join the Army if you fail
Look out kid, you're gonna get hit
By losers, cheaters, six-time users
Hanging 'round the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool's looking for a new fool
Don't follow leaders, a-watch the parking meters
Oh, get born, keep warm
Short pants, romance
Learn to dance, get dressed
Get blessed, try to be a success
Please her, please him, buy gifts
Don't steal, don't lift
20 years of schoolin' and they put you on the day shift
Look out kid, they keep it all hid
Better jump down a manhole, light yourself a candle
Don't wear sandals, try to avoid the scandals
Don't want to be a bum, you better chew gum
The pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles35EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Desolation Row,"They’re selling postcards of the hanging
They’re painting the passports brown
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors
The circus is in town
Here comes the blind commissioner
They’ve got him in a trance
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker
The other is in his pants

And the riot squad, they’re restless
They need somewhere to go
As Lady and I look out tonight
From Desolation Row

Cinderella, she seems so easy
""It takes one to know one,"" she smiles
And puts her hands in her back pockets
Bette Davis style
And in comes Romeo, he’s moaning
“You Belong to Me, I Believe”
And someone says, “You’re in the wrong place, my friend
You'd better leave”
And the only sound that’s left
After the ambulances go
Is Cinderella sweeping up
On Desolation Row

Now the moon is almost hidden
The stars are beginning to hide
The fortune-telling lady
Has even taken all her things inside
All except for Cain and Abel
And the hunchback of Notre Dame
Everybody is making love
Or else expecting rain

And the Good Samaritan, he’s dressing
He’s getting ready for the show
He’s going to the carnival tonight
On Desolation Row

Ophelia, she’s ’neath the window
For her I feel so afraid
On her twenty-second birthday
She already is an old maid
To her, death is quite romantic
She wears an iron vest
Her profession’s her religion
Her sin is her lifelessness
And though her eyes are fixed upon
Noah’s great rainbow
She spends her time peeking
Into Desolation Row

Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood
With his memories in a trunk
Passed this way an hour ago
With his friend, a jealous monk
Now he looked so immaculately frightful
As he bummed a cigarette
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes
And reciting the alphabet

You would not think to look at him
But he was famous long ago
For playing the electric violin
On Desolation Row

Dr. Filth, he keeps his world
Inside of a leather cup
But all his sexless patients
They’re trying to blow it up
Now his nurse, some local loser
She’s in charge of the cyanide hole
And she also keeps the cards that read
“Have mercy on his soul”
They all play on the pennywhistle
You can hear them blow
If you lean your head out far enough
From Desolation Row

Across the street they’ve nailed the curtains
They’re getting ready for the feast
The Phantom of the Opera
In a perfect image of a priest
They are spoon feeding Casanova
To get him to feel more assured
Then they’ll kill him with self-confidence
After poisoning him with words

And the Phantom’s shouting to skinny girls
“Get outta here if you don’t know
Casanova is just being punished for going
To Desolation Row”

At midnight all the agents
And the superhuman crew
Come out and round up everyone
That knows more than they do
Then they bring them to the factory
Where the heart attack machine
Is strapped across their shoulders
And then the kerosene

Is brought down from the castles
By insurance men who go
Check to see that nobody is escaping
To Desolation Row

Praise be to Nero’s Neptune
The Titanic sails at dawn
Everybody’s shouting
“Which side are you on?”
And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot
Fighting in the captain’s tower
While calypso singers laugh at them
And fishermen hold flowers

Between the windows of the sea
Where lovely mermaids flow
And nobody has to think too much
About Desolation Row


Yes, I received your letter yesterday
About the time the doorknob broke
When you asked me how I was doing
Was that some kinda joke?
All these people that you mention
Yes, I know them, they’re quite lame
I had to rearrange their faces
And give them all another name

Right now, I can’t read too good
Don’t send me no more letters, no
Not unless you mail them
From Desolation Row

Tangled Up in Blue,"Early one morning the sun was shining
I was laying in bed
Wondering if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red
Her folks they said our lives together
Sure was going to be rough
They never did like Mama's homemade dress
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
And I was standing on the side of the road
Rain falling on my shoes
Heading out for the East Coast
Lord knows I've paid some dues
Getting through
Tangled up in blue

She was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam, I guess
But I used a little too much force
We drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out West
Split up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best
She turned around to look at me
As I was walking away
I heard her say over my shoulder
""We'll meet again someday
On the avenue""
Tangled up in blue
I had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all that much
And one day the ax just fell
So I drifted down to New Orleans
Where I lucky was to be employed
Working for a while on a fishing boat
Right outside of Delacroix
But all the while I was alone
The past was close behind
I seen a lot of women
But she never escaped my mind
And I just grew
Tangled up in blue

She was working in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer
I just kept looking at the side of her face
In the spotlight, so clear
And later on, when the crowd thinned out
I was just about to do the same
She was standing there, in back of my chair
Said to me ""Tell me, don't I know your name?""
I muttered something underneath my breath
She studied the lines on my face
I must admit, I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces
Of my shoe
Tangled up in blue
She lit a burner on the stove
And offered me a pipe
""I thought you'd never say hello"" she said
""You look like the silent type""
Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century
And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burning coal
Pouring off of every page
Like it was written in my soul
From me to you
Tangled up in blue

I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs
There was music in the cafes at night
And revolution in the air
Then he started into dealing with slaves
And something inside of him died
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside
And when it finally, the bottom fell out
I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keeping on
Like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue
So now I'm going back again
I got to get to her somehow
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now
Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenter's wives
Don't know how it all got started
I don't know what they're doing with their lives
But me, I'm still on the road
A-heading for another joint
We always did feel the same
We just saw it from a different point
Of view

Masters of War,"Come, you masters of war
You that build the big guns
You that build the death planes
You that build all the bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks
I just want you to know
I can see through your masks

You that never done nothing
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it's your little toy
You put a gun in my hand
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
When the fast bullets fly

Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A world war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain
You fasten all the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you set back and watch
While the death count gets higher
You hide in your mansion
While the young people's blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud

You've thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
You ain't worth the blood
That runs in your veins

How much do I know
To talk out of turn?
You might say that I'm young
You might say I'm unlearned
But there's one thing I know
Though I'm younger than you
That even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do
Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good?
Will it buy you forgiveness?
Do you think that it could?
I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul

And I hope that you die
And your death will come soon
I will follow your casket
By the pale afternoon
And I'll watch while you're lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I'll stand over your grave
'Til I'm sure that you're dead18EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door,"Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Mama, take this badge off of me
I can’t use it anymore
It’s getting dark, too dark to see
I feel I’m knockin' upon heaven’s door

Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door

Mama, put my guns in the ground
I can’t shoot them anymore
That long black cloud is coming down
I feel I’m knockin' on heaven’s door

Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven’s door

"It’s Alright, Ma (I’m Only Bleeding)","Darkness at the break of noon
Shadows even the silver spoon
The handmade blade, the child's balloon
Eclipses both the sun and moon
To understand you know too soon
There is no sense in trying

Pointed threats they bluff with scorn
Suicide remarks are torn
From the fools gold mouthpiece the hollow horn
Plays wasted words, proves to warn
That he not busy being born
Is busy dying

Temptation's page flies out the door
You follow, find yourself at war
Watch waterfalls of pity roar
You feel to moan, but unlike before
You discover that you'd just be one more
Person crying

So don't fear if you hear
A foreign sound to your ear
It's alright, Ma, I'm only sighing
As some warn victory, some downfall
Private reasons, great or small
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
To make all that should be killed to crawl
While others say don't hate nothing at all
Except hatred

Disillusioned words like bullets bark
As human gods aim for their mark
Make everything from toy guns that spark
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark
It's easy to see without lookin' too far
That not much is really sacred

While preachers preach of evil fates
Teachers teach that knowledge waits
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates
Goodness hides behind its gates
But even the President of the United States
Sometimes must have to stand naked

And though the rules of the road have been lodged
It's only people's games that you got to dodge
And it's alright, Ma, I can make it
Advertising signs that con
You into thinking you're the one
That can do what's never been done
That can win what's never been won
Meantime, life outside goes on
All around you

You lose yourself, you reappear
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear
Alone you stand with nobody near
When a trembling distant voice, unclear
Startles your sleeping ears to hear
That somebody thinks they really found you

A question in your nerves is lit
Yet you know there is no answer fit
To satisfy, ensure you not to quit
To keep it in your mind and not forget
That it is not he, or she, or them, or it
That you belong to

But though the masters make the rules
For the wise men and the fools
I got nothing, Ma, to live up to
For them that must obey authority
That they do not respect in any degree
Who despise their jobs, their destiny
Speak jealously of them that are free
Do what they do just to be
Nothing more than something they invest in

While some on principles baptized
To strict party platform ties
Social clubs in drag disguise
Outsiders they can freely criticize
Tell nothing except who to idolize
And say ""God bless him""

While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Gargles in the rat race choir
Bent out of shape from society's pliers
Cares not to come up any higher
But rather get you down in the hole
That he's in

But I mean no harm, nor put fault
On anyone that lives in a vault
But it's alright, Ma, if I can't please him

Old lady judges watch people in pairs
Limited in sex, they dare
To push fake morals, insult and stare
While money doesn't talk, it swears
Obscenity, who really cares
Propaganda, all is phony

While them that defend what they cannot see
With a killer's pride, security
It blows the minds most bitterly
For them that think death's honesty
Won't fall upon 'em naturally
Life sometimes must get lonely

My eyes collide head-on with stuffed
Graveyards, false goals, I scuff
At pettiness which plays so rough
Walk upside down inside handcuffs
Kick my legs to crash it off
Say, okay, I've had enough
What else can you show me?

And if my thought-dreams could be seen
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine
But it's alright, Ma, it's life, and life only17EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Girl from the North Country,"If you’re travelin' in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine

If you go when the snowflakes storm
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see if she has a coat so warm
To keep her from the howling winds

Please see if her hair hangs long
If it rolls and flows all down her breast
Please see for me if her hair's hangin' long
For that’s the way I remember her best

I’m a-wondering if she remembers me at all
Many times I’ve often prayed
In the darkness of my night
In the brightness of my day

So if you’re travelin' the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine16EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
"It’s All Over Now, Baby Blue","You must leave now
Take what you need, you think will last
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Crying like a fire in the sun

Look out, the saints are coming through
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense
Take what you have gathered from coincidence
The empty handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets

The sky, too, is folding under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home
All your reindeer armies are all going home
Your lover who just walked out the door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor
The carpet, too, is moving under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

Leave your stepping stones behind
There's something that calls for you
Forget the dead you've left
They will not follow you
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore

Strike another match, go start anew
And it's all over now, Baby Blue13EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Tempest,"The pale moon rose in its glory
Out o'er the Western town
She told a sad, sad story
Of the great ship that went down

T'was the fourteenth day of April
Over the waves she rode
Sailing into tomorrow
To a gilded age foretold

The night was black with starlight
The seas were sharp and clear
Moving through the shadows
The promised hour was near

Lights were holding steady
Gliding over the foam
All the lords and ladies
Heading for their eternal home

The chandeliers were swaying
From the balustrades above
The orchestra was playing
Songs of faded love
The watchman, he lay dreaming
As the ballroom dancers twirled
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
Into the underworld

Leo took his sketchbook
He was often so inclined
He closed his eyes and painted
The scenery in his mind

Cupid struck his bosom
And broke it with a snap
The closest woman to him
He fell into her lap

He heard a loud commotion
Something sounded wrong
His inner spirit was saying
That he couldn't stand here long

He staggered to the quarterdeck
No time now to sleep
Water on the quarterdeck
Already three foot deep
Smokestack was leaning sideways
Heavy feet began to pound
He walked into the whirlwind
Sky splitting all around

The ship was going under
The universe had opened wide
The roll was called up yonder
The angels turned aside

Lights down in the hallway
Flickering dim and dull
Dead bodies already floating
In the double bottom hull

The engines then exploded
Propellers they failed to start
The boilers overloaded
The ship's bow split apart

Passengers were flying
Backward, forward, far and fast
They mumbled, fumbled, and tumbled
Each one more weary than the last
The veil was torn asunder
'Tween the hours of twelve and one
No change, no sudden wonder
Could undo what had been done

The watchman lay there dreaming
At forty-five degrees
He dreamed that the Titanic was sinking
Dropping to her knees

Wellington he was sleeping
His bed began to slide
His valiant heart was beating
He pushed the tables aside

Glass of shattered crystal
Lay scattered roundabout
He strapped on both his pistols
How long could he hold out?

His men and his companions
Were nowhere to be seen
In silence there he waited for
Time and space to intervene

The passageway was narrow
There was blackness in the air
He saw every kind of sorrow
Heard voices everywhere

Alarm-bells were ringing
To hold back the swelling tide
Friends and lovers clinging
To each other side by side

Mothers and their daughters
Descending down the stairs
Jumped into the icy waters
Love and pity sent their prayers

The rich man, Mister Astor
Kissed his darling wife
He had no way of knowing
Be the last trip of his life

Calvin, Blake, and Wilson
Gambled in the dark
Not one of them would ever live to
Tell the tale or disembark

Brother rose up 'gainst brother
In every circumstance
They fought and slaughtered each other
In a deadly dance

They lowered down the lifeboats
From the sinking wreck
There were traitors, there were turncoats
Broken backs and broken necks

The bishop left his cabin
To help all those in need
Turned his eyes up to the heavens
Said, ""The poor are yours to feed""

Davey the brothel-keeper
Came out dismissed his girls
Saw the water getting deeper
Saw the changing of his world

Jim Backus smiled
He never learned to swim
Saw the little crippled child
And he gave his seat to him

He saw the starlight shining
Streaming from the East
Death was on the rampage
But his heart was now at peace

They battened down the hatches
But the hatches wouldn't hold
They drowned upon the staircase
Of brass and polished gold

Leo said to Cleo
I think I'm going mad
But he'd lost his mind already
Whatever mind he had

He tried to block the doorway
To save all those from harm
Blood from an open wound
Pouring down his arm

Petals fell from flowers
Tell all of them were gone
In the long and dreadful hours
The wizard's curse played on

The host was pouring brandy
He was going down slow
He stayed right to the end and he
Was the last to go

There were many, many others
Nameless here forever more
They never sailed the ocean
Or left their homes before

The watchman, he lay dreaming
The damage had been done
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
And he tried to tell someone

The captain, barely breathing
Kneeling at the wheel
Above him and beneath him
Fifty thousand tons of steel

He looked over at his compass
And he gazed into its face
Needle pointing downward
He knew he lost the race

In the dark illumination
He remembered bygone years
He read the Book of Revelation
And he filled his cup with tears

When the Reaper's task had ended
Sixteen hundred had gone to rest
The good, the bad, the rich, the poor
The loveliest and the best

They waited at the landing
And they tried to understand
But there is no understanding
For the judgment of God's hand

The news came over the wires
And struck with deadly force
The love had lost its fires
All things had run their course

The watchman he lay dreaming
Of all the things that can be
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
Into the deep blue sea3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Ballad of a Thin Man,"You walk into the room
With your pencil in your hand
You see somebody naked
And you, you say, ""Who is that man?""
You try so hard
But you don't understand
Just what you will say
When you get home

Because something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

You raise up your head
And you ask, ""Is this where it is?""
And somebody points to you and says
""It's his""
And you say, ""What's mine?""
And somebody else says, ""Well, what is?""
And you say, ""Oh my God, am I here all alone?""

But something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?
You hand in your ticket
And you go watch the geek
Who immediately walks up to you
When he hears you speak
And says, ""How does it feel to
Be such a freak?""
And you say, ""Impossible""
As he hands you a bone

And something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

You have many contacts
Among the lumberjacks
To get you facts
When someone attacks your imagination
But nobody has any respect
Anyway they already expect you
To all give a check
To tax-deductible charity organization
Aw, you've been with the professors
And they've all liked your looks
With great lawyers you have
Discussed lepers and crooks
You've been through all of
F. Scott Fitzgerald's books
You are very well read
It's well known
But something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

Well the sword swallower, he comes up to you
And then he kneels
He crosses himself
And then he clicks his high heels
And without further notice
He asks you how it feels
And he says, ""Here is your throat back
Thanks for the loan""

And something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

Now you see this one-eyed midget
Shouting the word ""Now""
And you say, ""For what reason?""
And he says, ""How?""
And you say, ""What does this mean?""
And he screams back ""You're a cow
Give me some milk or else go home""
And you know something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?

Well, you walk into the room
Like a camel and then you frown
You put your eyes in your pocket
And your nose on the ground
There oughtta be a law
Against you comin' around
You should be made
To wear earphones

'Cause something is happening here
But ya' don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Visions of Johanna,"Ain't it just like the night to play
Tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?
We sit here stranded
Though we're all doing our best to deny it
And Louise holds a handful of rain, tempting you to defy it
Lights flicker from the opposite loft
In this room the heat pipes just cough
The country music station plays soft
But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind

In the empty lot where the ladies play
Blindman's bluff with the key chain
And the all-night girls
They whisper of escapades out on the ""D"" train
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight
Ask himself if it's him or them that's insane
Louise, she's all right, she's just near
She's delicate and seems like the mirror
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
That Johanna's not here
The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously
And when bringing her name up
He speaks of a farewell kiss to me
He's sure got a lotta gall
To be so useless and all
Muttering small talk at the wall while I'm in the hall
Oh, how can I explain?
It's so hard to get on
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn

Inside the museums, Infinity goes up on trial
Voices echo, ""This is what salvation must be like after a while""
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues
You can tell by the way she smiles
See the primitive wallflower freeze
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze
Hear the one with the mustache say, ""Jeez, I can't find my knees""
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel

The peddler now speaks
To the countess who's pretending to care for him
Sayin', ""Name me someone that's not a parasite
And I'll go out and say a prayer for him""
But like Louise always says
""You can't look at much, can you, man?""
As she, herself, prepares for him
And Madonna, she still has not showed
We see this empty cage now corrode
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
The fiddler, he now steps to the road
He writes everything's been returned which was owed
On the back of the fish truck that loads
While my conscience explodes
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
I Contain Multitudes,"Today, and tomorrow, and yesterday, too
The flowers are dyin' like all things do
Follow me close, I’m going to Bally-na-Lee
I'll lose my mind if you don't come with me
I fuss with my hair, and I fight blood feuds
I contain multitudes
Got a tell-tale heart like Mr. Poe
Got skeletons in the walls of people you know
I’ll drink to the truth and the things we said
I'll drink to the man that shares your bed
I paint landscapes, and I paint nudes
I contain multitudes
A red Cadillac and a black mustache
Rings on my fingers that sparkle and flash
Tell me, what's next? What shall we do?
Half my soul, baby, belongs to you
I rollick and I frolic with all the young dudes
I contain multitudes
I'm just like Anne Frank, like Indiana Jones
And them British bad boys, the Rolling Stones
I go right to the edge, I go right to the end
I go right where all things lost are made good again
I sing the songs of experience like William Blake
I have no apologies to make
Everything's flowing all at the same time
I live on a boulevard of crime
I drive fast cars, and I eat fast foods
I contain multitudes
Pink pedal-pushers, red blue jeans
All the pretty maids, and all the old queens
All the old queens from all my past lives
I carry four pistols and two large knives
I'm a man of contradictions, I'm a man of many moods
I contain multitudes
You greedy old wolf, I'll show you my heart
But not all of it, only the hateful parts
I’ll sell you down the river, I’ll put a price on your head
What more can I tell you? I sleep with life and death in the same bed
Get lost, madame, get up off my knee
Keep your mouth away from me
I'll keep the path open, the path in my mind
I’ll see to it that there's no love left behind
I'll play Beethoven's sonatas, Chopin’s preludes
I contain multitudes8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
To Fall in Love with You,"A tear goes down my day is real
But your drying eye upon the shame
Each needs a road for me from you
What paradise? what can I do?
That die for my and the day is dark
I can’t believe for your touch
What I could find oh time is right
If I fell in love to fall in love
To fall in love with you
The day is dark, our time is right
Day in the night deep in the night
I can’t yet be back I heard my- surprise
I see it in your lips I knew it in your eyes
Well I feel your love and I feel no shame
I can’t unleash your horde I call your name
What you’re to me what can I do?
To fall in love to fall in love
To fall in love with you
It just rolls upon the sand
Ever this for now I’m made a man
Can make you see what I can find
I know it in my days ah in my daily mind
Oh will ages roll will ages fly?
I hear your name where angels lie
What do I know? for to come it’s true
To fall in love To fall in love
To fall in love with you
How can the doors trust on a nail?
How can I be surprised of most every day?
In the distant road I can’t be the same
I feel no love I feel no shame
I can’t watch the bay out on my own
We’ve a destined man I can attest it all
I didn’t I could find where I could go
To fall in love to fall in love
To fall in love with you3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Shelter from the Storm,"'Twas in another lifetime
One of toil and blood
When blackness was a virtue
The road was full of mud
I came in from the wilderness
A creature void of form
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""

And if I pass this way again
You can rest assured
I'll always do my best for her
On that I give my word
In a world of steel-eyed death and men
Who are fighting to be warm
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""

Not a word was spoke between us
There was little risk involved
Everything up to that point
Had been left unresolved
Try imagining a place
Where it's always safe and warm
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""
I was burned out from exhaustion
Buried in the hail
Poisoned in the bushes
And blown out on the trail
Hunted like a crocodile
Ravaged in the corn
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""

Suddenly I turned around
And she was standing there
With silver bracelets on her wrists
And flowers in her hair
She walked up to me so gracefully
And took my crown of thorns
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""

Now there's a wall between us
Something there's been lost
I took too much for granted
I got my signals crossed
Just to think that it all began
On an uneventful morn
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""
Well the deputy walks on hard nails
And the preacher rides a mount
But nothing really matters much
It's doom alone that counts
And the one-eyed undertaker
He blows a futile horn
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm

I've heard newborn babies wailing
Like a mourning dove
And old men with broken teeth
Stranded without love
Do I understand your question, then
Is it hopeless and forlorn
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""

In a little hilltop village
They gambled for my clothes
I bargained for salvation
And she gave me a lethal dose
I offered up my innocence
And I got repaid with scorn
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""
Well, I'm living in a foreign country
But I'm bound to cross the line
Beauty walks a razor's edge
Someday I'll make it mine
If I could only turn back the clock
To when God and her were born
""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm""14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Lay Lady Lay,"Lay, lady, lay
Lay across my big brass bed
Lay, lady, lay
Lay across my big brass bed
Whatever colors you have in your mind
I’ll show them to you and you’ll see them shine

Lay, lady, lay
Lay across my big brass bed
Stay, lady, stay
Stay with your man awhile
Until the break of day, let me see ya' make him smile
His clothes are dirty but his, his hands are clean
And you’re the best thing that he’s ever seen

Stay, lady, stay
Stay with your man awhile

Why wait any longer for the world to begin
You can have your cake and eat it too
Why wait any longer for the one you love
When he’s standing in front of you
Lay, lady, lay
Lay across my big brass bed
Stay, lady, stay
Stay while the night is still ahead
I long to see you in the morning light
I long to reach for you in the night

Stay, lady, stay
Stay while the night is still ahead7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Boots of Spanish Leather,"Oh, I’m sailin' away my own true love
I’m a-sailin' away in the morning
Is there somethin' I can send you from across the sea
From the place that I’ll be landing?

No, there’s nothin' you can send me, my own true love
There’s nothin' I'm a-wishing to be ownin'
Just a-carry yourself back to me unspoiled
From across that lonesome ocean

Ah, but I just thought you might want somethin' fine
Made of silver or of golden
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Or from the coast of Barcelona

Well, if I had the stars from the darkest night
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean
I’d forsake them all for your sweet kiss
For that’s all I’m a-wishin' to be ownin'

Well I might be gone a long old time
And it’s only that I’m asking
Is there somethin' I can send you to remember me by
To make your time more easy passing
Oh, how can, how can you ask me again
It only brings me sorrow
The same thing I would want today
I want again tomorrow

I got a letter on a lonesome day
It was from her ship a-sailin'
Sayin' I don’t know when I’ll be comin' back again
It depends on how I’m a-feelin'

If a-you, my love, must think that-a-way
I’m sure your mind is a-roamin'
I’m sure your thoughts are not with me
But with the country to where you’re goin'

So take heed, take heed of the western winds
Take heed of the stormy weather
And yes, there’s somethin' you can send back to me
Spanish boots of Spanish leather9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Idiot Wind,"Someone’s got it in for me
They’re planting stories in the press
Whoever it is I wish they’d cut it out quick
But when they will I can only guess
They say I shot a man named Gray
And took his wife to Italy
She inherited a million bucks
And when she died it came to me
I can’t help it if I’m lucky

People see me all the time
And they just can’t remember how to act
Their minds are filled with big ideas
Images and distorted facts
Even you, yesterday
You had to ask me where it was at
I couldn’t believe after all these years
You didn’t know me any better than that
Sweet lady

Idiot wind
Blowing every time you move your mouth
Blowing down the backroads heading south
Idiot wind
Blowing every time you move your teeth
You’re an idiot, babe
It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe
I ran into the fortune-teller
Who said beware of lightning that might strike
I haven’t known peace and quiet
For so long, I can’t remember what it’s like
There’s a lone soldier on the cross
Smoke pouring out of a boxcar door
You didn’t know it, you didn’t think it could be done
In the final end he won the war
After losing every battle

I woke up on the roadside
Daydreaming about the way things sometimes are
Visions of your chestnut mare
Shoot through my head and are making me see stars
You hurt the ones that I love best
And cover up the truth with lies
One day you’ll be in the ditch
Flies buzzing around your eyes
Blood on your saddle

Idiot wind
Blowing through the flowers on your tomb
Blowing through the curtains in your room
Idiot wind
Blowing every time you move your teeth
You’re an idiot, babe
It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe
It was gravity which pulled us down
And destiny which broke us apart
You tamed the lion in my cage
But it just wasn’t enough to change my heart
Now everything’s a little upside down
As a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped
What’s good is bad, what’s bad is good
You’ll find out when you reach the top
You’re on the bottom

I noticed at the ceremony
Your corrupt ways had finally made you blind
I can’t remember your face anymore
Your mouth has changed, your eyes don’t look into mine
The priest wore black on the seventh day
And sat stone-faced while the building burned
I waited for you on the running boards
Near the cypress trees, while the springtime turned
Slowly into Autumn

Idiot wind
Blowing like a circle around my skull
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol
Idiot wind
Blowing every time you move your teeth
You’re an idiot, babe
It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe
I can’t feel you anymore
I can’t even touch the books you’ve read
Every time I crawl past your door
I been wishing I've been somebody else instead
Down the highway, down the tracks
Down the road to ecstasy
I followed you beneath the stars
Hounded by your memory
And all your raging glory

I been double-crossed now
For the very last time and now I’m finally free
I kissed goodbye the howling beast
On the borderline which separated you from me
You’ll never know the hurt I suffered
Nor the pain I rise above
And I’ll never know the same about you
Your holiness or your kind of love
And it makes me feel so sorry

Idiot wind
Blowing through the buttons of our coats
Blowing through the letters that we wrote
Idiot wind
Blowing through the dust upon our shelves
We’re idiots, babe
It’s a wonder we can even feed ourselves9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
My Back Pages,"Crimson flames tied through my ears
Rolling high and mighty traps
Pounced with fire on flaming roads
Using ideas as my maps
“We’ll meet on edges, soon,” said I
Proud 'neath heated brow

Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now

Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth
“Rip down all hate,” I screamed
Lies that life is black and white
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed
Romantic facts of musketeers
Foundationed deep, somehow

Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now

Girls’ faces formed the forward path
From phony jealousy
To memorizing politics
Of ancient history
Flung down by corpse evangelists
Un-thought of, though, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now

A self-ordained professor’s tongue
Too serious to fool
Spouted out that liberty
Is just equality in school
“Equality,” I spoke the word
As if a wedding vow

Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now

In a soldier’s stance, I aimed my hand
At the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not that I’d become my enemy
In the instant that I preach
My existence led by confusion boats
Mutiny from stern to bow

Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats
Too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking
I had something to protect
Good and bad, I define these terms
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow

Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Just Like a Woman,"Nobody feels any pain
Tonight as I stand inside the rain
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls

She takes just like a woman, yeah she does
She makes love just like a woman, yeah she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl

Queen Mary, she's my friend
Yes, I believe I'll go see her again
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
'Til she finally sees that she's like all the rest
With her fog, her amphetamine and her pearls

She takes just like a woman, yes
She makes love just like a woman, yeah she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl
Yeah, it was raining from the first
And I was dying there of thirst
So I came in here
And your long-time curse hurts
But what's worse
Is this pain in here
I can't stay in here

Ain't it clear that I just can't fit
Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit
But when we meet again, introduced as friends
Please don't let on that you knew me when
I was hungry and it was your world

Ah, you fake just like a woman, yes, you do
You make love just like a woman, yes, you do
Then you ache just like a woman
But ya' break just like a little girl

Simple Twist of Fate,"They sat together in the park
As the evening sky grew dark
She looked at him and he felt a spark
Tingle to his bones
'Twas then he felt alone
And wished that he'd gone straight
And watched out for a simple twist of fate

They walked alone by the old canal
A little confused, I remember well
And stopped into a strange hotel
With a neon burning bright
He felt the heat of the night
Hit him like a freight train
Moving with a simple twist of fate

A saxophone someplace far-off played
As she was walking on by the arcade
As the light bust through a beat-up shade
Where he was wakin' up
She dropped a coin into the cup
Of a blind man at the gate
And forgot about a simple twist of fate
He woke up, the room was bare
He didn't see her anywhere
He told himself he didn't care
Pushed the window open wide
Felt an emptiness inside
To which he just could not relate
Brought on by a simple twist of fate
He hears the ticking of the clocks
And walks along with a parrot that talks
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks
Where the sailors all come in
Maybe she'll pick him out again
How long must he wait?
One more time, for a simple twist of fate

People tell me it's a sin
To know and feel too much within
I still believe she was my twin
But I lost the ring
She was born in spring
But I was born too late
Blame it on a simple twist of fate14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
It Ain’t Me Babe,"Go away from my window
Leave at your own chosen speed
I’m not the one you want, babe
I’m not the one you need
You say you're looking for someone
Who's never weak but always strong
To protect you and defend you
Whether you are right or wrong
Someone to open each and every door

But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you’re looking for, babe

Go lightly from the ledge, babe
Go lightly on the ground
I’m not the one you want, babe
I will only let you down
You say you're looking for someone
Who will promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes for you
Someone to close his heart
Someone who will die for you and more
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you’re looking for, babe

Go melt back in the night
Everything inside is made of stone
There's nothing in here moving
And anyway I'm not alone
You say you're lookin' for someone
Who'll pick you up each time you fall
To gather flowers constantly
And to come each time you call
A lover for your life and nothing more

But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you’re looking for, babe5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Highway 61 Revisited,"Oh God said to Abraham, “Kill me a son”
Abe said, “Man, you must be puttin' me on”
God say, “No.”
Abe say, “What?”
God say, “You can do what you want, Abe, but
The next time you see me comin' you better run”
Well Abe said, “Where you want this killin' done?”
God said, “Out on Highway 61”

Well Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose
Welfare Department, they wouldn’t give him no clothes
He asked poor Howard, ""Where can I go?""
Howard said, ""There’s only one place I know""
Sam said, ""Tell me quick man, I got to run""
Oh Howard just pointed with his gun
And said, ""That way, down Highway 61""

Well Mack the Finger said to Louie the King
""I got forty red, white and blue shoestrings
And a thousand telephones that don’t ring
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?""
And Louie the King said ""Let me think for a minute son""
And he said ""Yes, I think it can be easily done
Just take everything down to Highway 61""
Now the fifth daughter on the twelfth night
Told the first father that things weren’t right
""My complexion"" she says ""is much too white""
He said ""Come here and step into the light""
He says ""Hmm you’re right
Let me tell the second mother this has been done""
But the second mother was with the seventh son
And they were both out on Highway 61

Now the rovin' gambler he was very bored
Tryin' to create a next world war
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor
He said ""I never engaged in this kind of thing before
But yes I think it can be very easily done
We’ll just put some bleachers out in the sun
And have it on Highway 61""5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Tombstone Blues,"The sweet pretty things are in bed now of course
The city fathers they’re trying to endorse
The reincarnation of Paul Revere’s horse
But the town has no need to be nervous
The ghost of Belle Starr she hands down her wits
To Jezebel the nun she violently knits
A bald wig for Jack the Ripper who sits
At the head of the chamber of commerce

Mama’s in the factory
She ain't got no shoes
Daddy’s in the alley
He’s lookin' for food
I am in the kitchen
With the tombstone blues

The hysterical bride in the penny arcade
Screaming she moans, “I’ve just been made”
Then sends out for the doctor who pulls down the shade
And says, “My advice is to not let the boys in”
Now the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride
“Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride
You will not die, it’s not poison”
Mama’s in the factory
She ain't got no shoes
Daddy’s in the alley
He’s lookin' for food
I’m in the kitchen
With the tombstone blues

Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief
Looks up at his hero, the commander-in-chief
Saying, “Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?”
The commander-in-chief answers him while chasing a fly
Saying, ""Death to all those who would whimper and cry""
And dropping a barbell, he points to the sky
Saying, ""The sun’s not yellow, it’s chicken""

Mama’s in the factory
She ain't got no shoes
Daddy’s in the alley
He’s lookin' for food
I am in the kitchen
With the tombstone blues
The king of the Philistines his soldiers to save
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves
Puts the pied pipers in prison and fattens the slaves
Then sends them out to the jungle
Gypsy Davey with a blowtorch he burns out their camps
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
With a fantastic collection of stamps
To win friends and influence his uncle

Mama’s in the factory
She ain't got no shoes
Daddy’s in the alley
He’s lookin' for food
I’m in trouble
With the tombstone blues

The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone
Causes Galileo’s math book to get thrown
At Delilah who's sitting worthlessly alone
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter
Now I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille
He could die happily ever after
Mama’s in the factory
She ain't got no shoes
Daddy’s in the alley
He’s lookin' for food
I am in the kitchen
With the tombstone blues

Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
And the National Bank at a profit sells road maps for the soul
To the old folks home and the college
Now I wish I could write you a melody so plain
That could hold you dear lady from going insane
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Of your useless and pointless knowledge

Mama’s in the factory
She ain't got no shoes
Daddy’s in the alley
He’s lookin' for food
I am in the kitchen
With the tombstone blues9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Key West (Philosopher Pirate),"McKinley hollered, McKinley squalled
Doctor said, ""McKinley, death is on the wall
‪Say it to me, if you got something to confess""
‪I heard all about it, he was going down slow ‬
‪I heard it on the wireless radio ‬
‪From down in the boondocks way down in Key West
‪I’m searching for love, for inspiration ‬
‪On that pirate radio station
‪Coming out of Luxembourg and Budapest ‬
‪Radio signal, clear as can be
‪I'm so deep in love that I can hardly see ‬
‪Down on the flatlands, way down in Key West

‪Key West is the place to be ‬
‪If you're looking for immortality ‬
‪Stay on the road, follow the highway sign ‬
‪Key West is fine and fair
‪If you lost your mind, you will find it there
‪Key West is on the horizon line

‪I was born on the wrong side of the railroad track
‪Like Ginsberg, Corso and Kerouac
‪Like Louis and Jimmy and Buddy and all the rest ‬
‪Well, it might not be the thing to do ‬
‪But I'm sticking with you through and through ‬
‪Down in the flatlands, way down in Key West
‪I got both my feet planted square on the ground ‬
‪Got my right hand high with the thumb down ‬
‪Such is life, such is happiness
‪Hibiscus flowers, they grow everywhere here
‪If you wear one, put it behind your ear
‪Down in the bottom, way down in Key West ‬
‪Key West is the place to go
‪Down by the Gulf of Mexico ‬
‪Beyond the sea, beyond the shifting sand
‪Key West is the gateway key ‬
‪To innocence and purity ‬
‪Key West, Key West is the enchanted land

‪I've never lived in the land of Oz ‬
‪Or wasted my time with an unworthy cause ‬
‪It’s hot down here, and you can't be overdressed
‪Tiny blossoms of a toxic plant ‬
‪They can make you dizzy, I'd like to help you but I can't
‪Down in the flatlands, way down in Key West ‬
‪Well, the Fishtail Palms, and the orchid trees
‪They can give you that bleeding heart disease
‪People tell me I ought to try a little tenderness ‬
‪On Amelia Street, Bayview Park ‬
‪Walking in the shadows after dark ‬
‪Down under, way down in Key West ‬
‪I played Gumbo Limbo spirituals
‪I know all the Hindu rituals ‬
‪People tell me that I'm truly blessed ‬
Bougainvillea blooming in the summer, in the spring
Winter here is an unknown thing
Down in the flat lands, way down in Key West
Key West is under the sun, under the radar, under the gun
You stay to the left, and then you lean to the right
Feel the sunlight on your skin, and the healing virtues of the wind
Key West, Key West is the land of light

Wherever I travel, wherever I roam
I'm not that far from the convent home
I do what I think is right, what I think is best
Mystery Street off of Mallory Square
Truman had his White House there
East bound, West bound, way down in Key West
Twelve years old, they put me in a suit
Forced me to marry a prostitute
There were gold fringes on her wedding dress
That's my story, but not where it ends
She's still cute, and we're still friends
Down on the bottom, way down in Key West
I play both sides against the middle
Trying to pick up that pirate radio signal
I heard the news, I heard your last request
Fly around, my pretty little Miss
I don't love nobody, give me a kiss
Down on the bottom, way down in Key West
Key West is the place to be
If you're looking for immortality
Key West is paradise divine
Key West is fine and fair
If you lost your mind, you'll find it there
Key West is on the horizon line2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
I Want You,"The guilty undertaker sighs
The lonesome organ grinder cries
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you
The cracked bells and washed-out horns
Blow into my face with scorn
But it’s not that way
I wasn’t born to lose you
I want you, I want you
I want you, so bad
Honey, I want you

The drunken politician leaps
Upon the street where mothers weep
And the saviors who are fast asleep, they wait for you
And I wait for them to interrupt
Me drinking from my broken cup
And ask me to
Open up the gate for you

I want you, I want you
Yes I want you, so bad
Honey, I want you
How my fathers, they’ve gone down
True love they’ve been without it
But all their daughters put me down
'Cause I don’t think about it

Well, I'll return to the Queen of Spades
And talk with my chambermaid
She knows that I’m not afraid to look at her
She is good to me
And there’s nothing she doesn’t see
She knows where I’d like to be
But it doesn’t matter

I want you, I want you
Yes I want you, so bad
Honey, I want you

Now your dancing child with his Chinese suit
He spoke to me, I took his flute
No, I wasn’t very cute to him, was I?
But I did it, because he lied
And because he took you for a ride
Uhm, because time was on his side
And because I

My Own Version of You,"All through the summers, into January
I've been visiting morgues and monasteries
Looking for the necessary body parts
Limbs and livers and brains and hearts
I'll bring someone to life, is what I wanna do
I wanna create my own version of you
Well, it must be the winter of my discontent
I wish you'd've taken me with you wherever you went
They talk all night and they talk all day
Not for a minute do I believe anything they say
I'm gon' bring someone to life, someone I've never seen
You know what I mean, you know exactly what I mean
I'll take the Scarface Pacino and The Godfather Brando
Mix it up in a tank and get a robot commando
If I do it up right and put the head on straight
I'll be saved by the creature that I create
I'll get blood from a cactus, gunpowder from ice
I don't gamble with cards and I don't shoot no dice
Can you look at my face with your sightless eyes?
Can you cross your heart and hope to die?
I'll bring someone to life, someone for real
Someone who feels the way that I feel
I study Sanskrit and Arabic to improve my mind
I wanna do things for the benefit of all mankind
I say to the willow tree, ""Don't weep for me""
I'm saying to hell to all things that I used to be
Well, I get into trouble, then I hit the wall
No place to turn, no place at all
I'll pick a number between a-one and two
And I ask myself, ""What would Julius Caesar do?""
I will bring someone to life in more ways than one
Don't matter how long it takes, it'll be done when it's done
I'm gonna make you play the piano like Leon Russell
Like Liberace, like St. John the Apostle
I'll play every number that I can play
I'll see you maybe on Judgment Day
After midnight, if you still wanna meet
I'll be at the Black Horse Tavern on Armageddon Street
Two doors down, not that far to walk
I'll hear your footsteps, you won't have to knock
I'll bring someone to life, balance the scales
I'm not gonna get involved any insignificant details
You can bring it to St. Peter
You can bring it to Jerome
You can bring it all the way over
Bring it all the way home
Bring it to the corner where the children play
You can bring it to me on a silver tray
I'll bring someone to life, spare no expense
Do it with decency and common sense
Can you tell me what it means, to be or not to be?
You won't get away with fooling me
Can you help me walk that moonlight mile?
Can you give me the blessings of your smile?
I'll bring someone to life, use all of my powers
Do it in the dark, in the wee, small hours
I can see the history of the whole human race
It's all right there, it's carved into your face
Should I break it all down? Should I fall on my knees?
Is there light at the end of the tunnel, can you tell me, please?
Stand over there by the cypress tree
Where the Trojan women and children were sold into slavery
Long before the first Crusade
Way back before England or America were made
Step right into the burning hell
Where some of the best-known enemies of mankind dwell
Mr. Freud with his dreams, Mr. Marx with his ax
See the raw hide lash rip the skin from their backs
Got the right spirit, you can feel it, you can hear it
You've got what they call the immortal spirit
You can feel it all night, you can feel it in the morn'
It creeps in your body the day you were born
One strike of lightning is all that I need
And a blast of electricity that runs at top speed
Show me your ribs, I'll stick in the knife
Gonna jumpstart my creation to life
I wanna bring someone to life, turn back the years
Do it with laughter and do it with tears3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again,"Oh, the ragman draws circles
Up and down the block

To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley
With his pointed shoes and his bells
Speaking to some French girl
Who says she knows me well
And I would send a message
To find out if she's talked
But the post office has been stolen
And the mailbox is locked
Oh, Mama
Can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

Mona tried to tell me
To stay away from the train line
She said that all the railroad men
Just drink up your blood like wine
And I said, ""Oh, I didn't know that
But then again, there's only one I've met
And he just smoked my eyelids
And punched my cigarette""

Oh, Mama
Can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

Grandpa died last week
And now he's buried in the rocks
But everybody still talks about
How badly they were shocked
But me, I expected it to happen
I knew he'd lost control
When I sp— he'd built a fire on Main Street
And shot it full of holes
Oh, Mama
Can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

Now the senator came down here
Showing everyone his gun
Handing out free tickets
To the wedding of his son
And me, I nearly got busted
And wouldn't it be my luck
To get caught without a ticket
And be discovered beneath a truck

Oh, Mama
Is this really the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

Now the tea preacher looked so baffled
When I asked him why he dressed
With twenty pounds of headlines
Stapled to his chest
But he cursed me when I proved to him
Then I whispered, said, ""Not even you can hide
You see, you're just like me
I hope you're satisfied""
Oh, Mama
Can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

Now the rainman gave me two cures
Then he said, ""Jump right in""
The one was Texas medicine
The other was just railroad gin
And like a fool I mixed them
And it strangled up my mind
And now people just get uglier
And I have no sense of time

Oh, Mama
Can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

Now when Ruthie says come see her
In her honky-tonk lagoon
Where I can watch her waltz for free
'Neath her Panamanian moon
And I say, ""Aw, come on now
You know you know about my debutante""
And she says, ""Your debutante just knows what you need
But I know what you want""

Oh, Mama
Can this really be the end?
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

Now the bricks lay on Grand Street
Where the neon madmen climb
They all fall there so perfectly
It all seems so well timed
And here I sit so patiently
Waiting to find out what price
You have to pay to get out of
Going through all these things twice

Oh, Mama
Is this really the end?
To be stuck here inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Maggie’s Farm,"I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
No, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
Well, I wake up in the morning
Fold my hands and pray for rain
I got a head full of ideas
That are drivin' me insane

It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more

I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more
Well, he hands you a nickel
He hands you a dime
He asks you with a grin
If you're having a good time

Then he fines you every time you slam the door
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more

I ain't gonna work for Maggie's Pa no more
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's Pa no more
Well, he puts his cigar
Out in your face just for kicks
His bedroom window
It is made out of bricks
The National Guard stands around his door
Ah, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's Pa no more

I ain't gonna work for Maggie's Ma no more
No, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's Ma no more
Well, she talks to all the servants
About man and God and law
Everybody says
She's the brains behind Pa

She's 68, but she says she's 54
I ain't gonna work for Maggie's Ma no more

I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more
Well, I try my best
To be just like I am
But everybody wants you
To be just like them

They say ""Sing while you slave"" and I just get bored
Ah, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
False Prophet,"Another day that don't end
Another ship goin' out
Another day of anger, bitterness, and doubt
I know how it happened
I saw it begin
I opened my heart to the world and the world came in

Hello, Mary Lou
Hello, Miss Pearl
My fleet-footed guides from the underworld
No stars in the sky shine brighter than you
You girls mean business and I do too

Well, I'm the enemy of treason
An enemy of strife
I'm the enemy of the unlived meaningless life
I ain't no false prophet
I just know what I know
I go where only the lonely can go

I'm first among equals
Second to none
The last of the best
You can bury the rest
Bury 'em naked with their silver and gold
Put 'em six feet under and I pray for their souls
What are you lookin' at?
There's nothing to see
Just a cool breeze that's encircling me
Let's go for a walk in the garden
So far and so wide
We can sit in the shade by the fountain-side

I search the world over
For the Holy Grail
I sing songs of love
I sing songs of betrayal
Don't care what I drink
I don't care what I eat
I climb the mountains with swords on my bare feet

You don't know me, darlin'
You never would guess
I'm nothing like my ghostly appearance would suggest
I ain't no false prophet
I just said what I said
I'm just here to bring vengeance on somebody's head

Put out your hand
There's nothing to hold
Open your mouth
I'll stuff it with gold
Oh, you poor devil, look up if you will
The city of God is there on the hill
Hello, stranger
Hello and goodbye
You ruled the land
But so do I
You lusty old mule
You got a poisoned brain
I'll marry you to a ball and chain

You know, darlin'
The kind of life that I live
When your smile meets my smile
Something's got to give
I ain't no false prophet
No, I'm nobody's bride
Can't remember when I was born
And I forgot when I died7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Positively 4th Street,"You got a lot of nerve
To say you are my friend
When I was down
You just stood there grinning

You got a lot of nerve
To say you got a helping hand to lend
You just want to be on
The side that’s winning

You say I let you down
You know it’s not like that
If you’re so hurt
Why then don’t you show it?

You say you lost your faith
But that’s not where it’s at
You had no faith to lose
And you know it

I know the reason
That you talk behind my back
I used to be among the crowd
You’re in with
Do you take me for such a fool
To think I’d make contact
With the one who tries to hide
What he don’t know to begin with

You see me on the street
You always act surprised
You say “How are you? Good luck!”
But you don’t mean it

When you know as well as me
You’d rather see me paralyzed
Why don’t you just come out once
And scream it

No, I do not feel that good
When I see the heartbreaks you embrace
If I was a master thief
Perhaps I’d rob them

And now I know you’re dissatisfied
With your position and your place
Don’t you understand
It’s not my problem
I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
And just for that one moment
I could be you

Yes, I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
You’d know what a drag it is
To see you8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
I’ve Made Up My Mind to Give Myself to You,"I'm sittin' on my terrace, lost in the stars
Listening to the sounds of the sad guitars
Been thinking it all over and I've thought it all through
I've made up my mind to give myself to you
I saw the first fall of snow
I saw the flowers come and go
I don't think that anyone ever else ever knew
I've made up my mind to give myself to you
I'm giving myself to you, I am
From Salt Lake City to Birmingham
From East L.A. to San Antone
I don't think I can bear to live my life alone
My eye is like a shooting star
It looks at nothin' here or there, looks at nothin' near or far
No one ever told me, it's just something I knew
I've made up my mind to give myself to you
If I had the wings of a snow white dove
I'd preach the gospel, the gospel of love
A love so real, a love so true
I've made up my mind to give myself to you
Take me out traveling, you're a traveling man
Show me something I don't understand
I'm not what I was, things aren't what they were
I'll go far away from home with her
I traveled a long road of despair
I met no other traveler there
Lot of people gone, lot of people I knew
I've made up my mind to give myself to you
Well, my heart's like a river, a river that sings
Just takes me a while to realize things
I've seen the sunrise, I've seen the dawn
I'll lay down beside you when everyone's gone
I've traveled from the mountains to the sea
I hope that the gods go easy with me
I knew you'd say yes, I'm saying it too
I've made up my mind to give myself to you3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Just Like Tom Thumb’s Blues,"When you're lost in the rain in Juarez
When it's Easter time too
And your gravity fails
And negativity don't pull you through
Don't put on any airs
When you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue
They got some hungry women there
And they really make a mess outta you

Now if you see Saint Annie
Please tell her ""Thanks a lot""
I cannot move
My fingers are all in a knot
I don't have the strength
To get up and take another shot
And my best friend, my doctor
Won't even say what it is I've got

Sweet Melinda
The peasants call her the Goddess of Gloom
She speaks good English
And she invites you up into her room
And you're so kind
And careful not to go to her too soon
And she takes your voice
And leaves you howling at the moon
Up on Housing Project Hill
It's either fortune or fame
You must pick one or the other
Though neither of them are to be what they claim
If you're lookin' to get silly
You better go back to from where you came
Because the cops don't need you
And man, they expect the same

Now all the authorities
They just stand around and boast
How they blackmailed the Sergeant-at-Arms
Into leaving his post
And picking up Angel
Who just arrived here from the coast
Who looked so fine at first
But left lookin' just like a ghost

I started out on Burgundy
But soon hit the harder stuff
Everybody said they'd stand behind me
When the game got rough
But the joke was on me
There was nobody even there to bluff
I'm going back to New York City
I do believe I've had enough11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
You Belong to Me,"See the pyramids along the Nile
Watch the sun rise from a tropic isle
Just remember, darling, all the while
You belong to me
See the market place in old Algiers
Send me photographs and souvenirs
Just remember when a dream appears
You belong to me
I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too... and blue
Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
Just remember till you're home again
You belong to me
I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too... and blue
Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain

Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands,"With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
And your silver cross, and your voice like chimes
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
With your pockets well protected at last
And your streetcar visions which ya place on the grass
And your flesh like silk, and your face like glass
Who could they get to carry you?

Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums
Should I put them by your gate?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?

With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
And your basement clothes and your hollow face
Who among them can think he could outguess you?
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
Into your eyes where the moonlight swims
And your matchbook songs and your gypsy hymns
Who among them would try to impress you?
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums
Should I put them by your gate?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?

The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss
And ya wouldn't know it woulda happened like this
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew plugs
Who among them do ya think could resist you?

Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums
Should I leave them by your gate?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?

Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
To show you where the dead angels are that they used to hide
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
How could they ever mistake you?
They wished you’d accepted the blame for the farm
But with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
And with the child of the hoodlum wrapped up in your arms
How could they ever have persuaded you?
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
Where the sad-eyed prophets say that no man comes
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums
Should I leave them by your gate?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?

With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
And your magazine-husband who one day just had to go
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show
Who among them do you think would employ you?
Now you stand with your thief, you're on his parole
With your holy medallion and your fingertips now that fold
And your saintlike face and your ghost-like soul
Who among them could ever think it could destroy you?

Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
Where the sad-eyed prophet say that no man comes
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums
Should I leave them by your gate?
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?

Love Minus Zero/No Limit,"My love she speaks like silence
Without ideals or violence
She doesn't have to say she's faithful
Yet she's true, like ice, like fire

People carry roses
And make promises by the hours
My love she laughs like the flowers
Valentines can't buy her

In the dime stores and bus stations
People talk of situations
Read books, repeat quotations
Draw conclusions on the wall

Some speak of the future
My love she speaks softly
She knows there's no success like failure
And that failure's no success at all

The cloak and dagger dangles
Madams light the candles
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Even a pawn must hold a grudge
Statues made of match sticks
Crumble into one another
My love winks, she does not bother
She knows too much to argue or to judge

The bridge at midnight trembles
The country doctor rambles
Bankers' nieces seek perfection
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring

The wind howls like a hammer
The night blows rainy
My love she's like some raven
At my window with a broken wing3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Black Rider,"Black rider, black rider, you've been living too hard
Been up all night, have to stay on your guard
The path that you're walking, too narrow to walk
Every step of the way, another stumbling block
The road that you're on, same road that you know
Just not the same as it was a minute ago

Black rider, black rider, you've seen it all
You've seen the great world and you've seen the small
You fell into the fire and you're eating the flame
Better seal up your lips if you wanna stay in the game
Be reasonable, mister, be honest, be fair
Let all of your earthly thoughts be a prayer

Black rider, black rider, all dressed in black
I'm walking away, you try to make me look back
My heart is at rest, I'd like to keep it that way
I don't wanna fight, at least not today
Go home to your wife, stop visiting mine
One of these days I'll forget to be kind

Black rider, black rider, tell me when, tell me how
If there ever was a time, then let it be now
Let me go through, open the door
My soul is distressed, my mind is at war
Don't hug me, don't flatter me, don't turn on the charm
I'll take a sword and hack off your arm
Black rider, black rider, hold it right there
The size of your cock will get you nowhere
I'll suffer in silence, I'll not make a sound
Maybe I'll take the high moral ground
Some enchanted evening I'll sing you a song
Black rider, black rider, you've been on the job too long1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Talkin’ World War III Blues,"One time ago a crazy dream came to me
I dreamt I was walking to World War Three
I went to the doctor the very next day
To see what kind of words he could say
He said it was a bad dream
""I wouldn’t worry about it none, though
Them old dreams are only in your head""

I said “Hold it Doc, a World War passed through my brain”
He said “Nurse, get your pad, the boy’s insane”
He grabbed my arm, I said “Ouch!”
As I landed on the psychiatric couch
He said “Tell me about it”

Well, the whole thing started at 3 o’clock fast
It was all over by a quarter past
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
When I peeked out from a manhole cover
Wondering who turned the lights on us

Well, I got up and I walked around
Up and down the lonesome town
I stood a-wondering which way to go
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter
And walked on down the road
It was a normal day
Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
And I leaned my head and I give a yell
“Give me a string bean, I’m a hungry man”
A shotgun fired, and away I ran
I don’t blame him too much though, he didn't know me

Down at the corner by the hot-dog stand
I seen a man
I said “Howdy friend, I guess there’s just us two”
He screamed a bit, and away he flew
Thought I was a Communist

Well, I spied me a girl and before she could leave
I said “Let’s go and play Adam and Eve”
I took her by the hand, and my heart was thumping
When she said “Hey man, you crazy or something?
You seen what happened last time they started”

Well, I seen me a Cadillac window uptown
There was nobody around
I got into the driver’s seat
And I drove down 42nd Street
In my Cadillac
Good car to drive after a war
Well, I remember seeing some ad
So I turned on my Conelrad
But I didn’t pay the Con Ed bill
So the radio didn’t work so well
Turned on my record player —
It was Rock-a-day Johnny, singing “Tell Your Ma, Tell Your Pa
Our Love’s A-going to Grow, Ooh-wah, Ooh-wah”

I was feeling kind of lonesome and blue
I needed somebody to talk to
So I called up the operator of time
Just to hear a voice of some kind
“When you hear the beep it will be three o’clock”
She said that for over an hour
And I hung up

Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then
Saying “Hey I’ve been having the same old dreams
But mine was a little different, you see
I dreamt the only person left after the war was me
I didn’t see you around""

Well, now time passed and now it seems
Everybody’s having them dreams
Everybody sees their self
Walking around with no one else
""Half of the people can be part right all of the time
And some of the people can be all right part of the time
But all of the people can’t be all right all of the time""
I think Abraham Lincoln said that
“I’ll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours”
I said that10EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Roll On John,"Doctor, doctor tell me the time of day
Another bottle's empty, another penny spent
He turned around and he slowly walked away
They shot him in the back and down he went

Shine your light
Movin' on
You burned so bright
Roll on, John

From the Liverpool docks to the red-light Hamburg streets
Down in the quarry with the quarrymen
Playing to the big crowds, playing to the cheap seats
Another day in the life on your way to your journey's end

Shine your light
Movin' on
You burned so bright
Roll on, John

Sailin' through the trade winds bound for the South
Rags on your back just like any other slave
They tied your hands and they clamped your mouth
Wasn't no way out of that deep dark cave
Shine your light
Movin' on
You burned so bright
Roll on, John

I heard the news today, oh boy
They hauled your ship up on the shore
Now the city gone dark, there is no more joy
They tore the heart right out and cut him to the core

Shine your light
Movin' on
You burned so bright
Roll on, John

Put on your bags and get 'em packed
Leave right now, you won't be far from wrong
The sooner you go the quicker you'll be back
You've been cooped up on an island far too long

Shine your light
Movin' on
You burned so bright
Roll on, John
Slow down you're moving way too fast
Come together right now over me
Your bones are weary, you're about to breathe your last
Lord, you know how hard that it can be

Shine your light
Movin' on
You burned so bright
Roll on, John

Roll on, John, roll through the rain and snow
Take the right-hand road and go where the buffalo roam
They'll trap you in an ambush before you know
Too late now to sail back home

Shine your light
Movin' on
You burned so bright
Roll on, John

Tyger, tyger burning bright
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
In the forests of the night
Cover 'em over and let him sleep
Shine your light
Movin' on
You burned so bright
Roll on, John4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
You’re Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go,"I’ve seen love go by my door
It’s never been this close before
Never been so easy or so slow
I've been shooting in the dark too long
When something’s not right, it’s wrong
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

Dragon clouds so high above
I’ve only known careless love
It always just hit me from below
But this time 'round it’s more correct
Right on target, so direct
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

Purple clover, Queen Anne's lace
Crimson hair across your face
You could make me cry, if you don’t know
Can’t remember what I was thinking of
You might be spoilin’ me too much, love
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme
Blue river running slow and lazy
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time
Situations have ended sad
Relationships have all been bad
Mine’ve been like Verlaine’s and Rimbaud
But there’s no way I can compare
All them scenes to this affair
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

You're gonna make me wonder what I’m doin’
Staying far behind without you
You're gonna make me wonder what I’m sayin’
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to

I’ll look for you in old Honolulu
San Francisco or Ashtabula
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know
But I’ll see you in the sky above
In the tall grass, in the ones I love
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
"If You See Her, Say Hello","If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier
She left here last early Spring, is livin' there, I hear
Say for me that I'm all right though things get kind of slow
She might think that I've forgotten her, don't tell her it isn't so

We had a falling out, like lovers often will
And to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill
And though our separation, it pierced me to the heart
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart

If you get close to her, kiss her once for me
Always have respected her for doing what she did and gettin' free
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
Though the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay

I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm gettin' soft

Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast
If she's passin' back this way, I'm not that hard to find
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
With God on Our Side,"Oh my name it ain't nothin'
My age it means less
The country I come from
Is called the Midwest
I’s taught and brought up there
The laws to abide
And that the land that I live in
Has God on its side
Oh the history books tell it
They tell it so well
The cavalries charged
The Indians fell
The cavalries charged
The Indians died
Ah the country was young
With God on its side
The Spanish-American
War had its day
And the Civil War too
Was soon laid away
And the names of the heroes
I’s made to memorize
With guns in their hands
And God on their side
The First World War boys
It came and it went
The reason for fightin'
I never did get
But I learned to accept it
Accept it with pride
For you don’t count the dead
When God’s on your side
The Second World War
Came to an end
We forgave the Germans
And then we were friends
Though they murdered six million
In the ovens they fried
The Germans now too
Have God on their side
I’ve learned to hate the Russians
All through my whole life
If another war comes
It’s them we must fight
To hate them and fear them
To run and to hide
And accept it all bravely
With God on my side
But now we got weapons
Of chemical dust
If fire them we’re forced to
Then fire them we must
One push of the button
And a shot the world wide
And ya' never ask questions
When God’s on your side
Through many dark hour
I been thinking about this
That Jesus Christ
Was betrayed by a kiss
But I can’t think for ya'
You’ll have to decide
Whether Judas Iscariot
Had God on his side
So now as I’m leavin'
I’m weary as Hell
The confusion I’m feelin'
Ain't no tongue can tell
The words fill my head
And they fall to the floor
If God’s on our side
He’ll stop the next war8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
She Belongs to Me,"She's got everything she needs

She's nobody's child
The Law can't touch her at all

It sparkles before she speaks

Bow down to her on Sunday
Salute her when her birthday comes
For Halloween buy her a trumpet

While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing
Distant ships sailing into the mist
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing
Freedom just around the corner for you
But with the truth so far off, what good will it do?

Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman

So swiftly the sun sets in the sky
You rise up and say goodbye to no one
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
Both of their futures, so full of dread, you don't show one
Shedding off one more layer of skin
Keeping one step ahead of the persecutor within

Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman
You're a man of the mountains, you can walk on the clouds
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream twister
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah
But what do you care? Ain't nobody there would want to marry your sister
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name

Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman

Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers
In the smoke of the twilight on a milk-white steed
Michelangelo indeed could've carved out your features
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space
Half asleep near the stars with a small dog licking your face

Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame
Preacherman seeks the same, who'll get there first is uncertain
Nightsticks and water cannons, tear gas, padlocks
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin
Only a matter of time till night comes stepping in

Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman

It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery grey
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat
Take the motherless children off the street
And place them at the feet of a harlot
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response

Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
You’re a Big Girl Now,"Our conversation was short and sweet
It nearly swept me off-a my feet
And I'm back in the rain, oh, oh
And you are on dry land
You made it there somehow
You're a big girl now

Bird on the horizon, sitting on a fence
He's singing his song for me at his own expense
And I'm just like that bird, oh, oh
Singing just for you
I hope that you can hear
Hear me singing through these tears

Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast
Oh, but what a shame that all we've shared can't last
I can change, I swear, oh, oh
See what you can do
I can make it through
You can make it too

Love is so simple, to quote a phrase
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days
Oh, I know where I can find you, oh, oh
In somebody's room
It's a price I have to pay
You're a big girl all the way
A change in the weather is known to be extreme
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
I'm going out of my mind, oh, oh
With a pain that stops and starts
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Ever since we've been apart8EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Goodbye Jimmy Reed,"I live on a street named after a Saint
Women in the churches wear powder and paint
Where the Jews, and Catholics, and the Muslims all pray
I can tell they're Proddie from a mile away
Goodbye Jimmy Reed, Jimmy Reed indeed
Give me that old time religion, it's just what I need

For thine is kingdom, the power, the glory
Go tell it on the mountain, go tell the real story
Tell it in that straightforward, puritanical tone
In the mystic hours when a person's alone
Goodbye Jimmy Reed, godspeed
Thump on the Bible, proclaim a creed

You won't amount to much, the people all said
'Cause I didn't play guitar behind my head
Never pandered, never acted proud
Never took off my shoes, throw 'em in the crowd
Goodbye Jimmy Reed, goodbye, goodnight
Put a jewel in your crown and I put out the lights

They threw everything at me, everything in the book
I had nothing to fight with but a butcher's hook
They had no pity, they never lend a hand
I can't sing a song that I don't understand
Goodbye Jimmy Reed, goodbye, good luck
I can't play the record 'cause my needle got stuck
Transparent woman in a transparent dress
Suits you well, I must confess
I'll break open your grapes, I'll suck out the juice
I need you like my head needs a noose
Goodbye Jimmy Reed, goodbye and so long
I thought I could resist her but I was so wrong

God be with you, brother dear
If you don't mind me asking what brings you here?
Oh, nothing much, I'm just looking for the man
Need to see where he's lying in this lost land
Goodbye Jimmy Reed, and everything within ya
Can't you hear me calling from down in Virginia?1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Sara,"I laid on a dune, I looked at the sky
When the children were babies and played on the beach
You came up behind me, I saw you go by
You were always so close and still within reach

Sara, Sara
Whatever made you want to change your mind?
Sara, Sara
So easy to look at, so hard to define

I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand
They run to the water their buckets to fill
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
As they follow each other back up the hill

Sara, Sara
Sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life
Sara, Sara
Radiant jewel, mystical wife
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White
You in the marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar
Sara, oh Sara
It’s all so clear, I could never forget
Sara, oh Sara
Loving you is the one thing I’ll never regret

I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells
I’d taken the cure and had just gotten through
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel
Writing “Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands” for you

Sara, Sara
Wherever we travel we’re never apart
Sara, oh Sara
Beautiful lady, so dear to my heart

How did I meet you? I don’t know
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow
And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm

Sara, oh Sara
Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress
Sara, oh Sara
You must forgive me my unworthiness
Now the beach is deserted except for some kelp
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore
You always responded when I needed your help
You give me a map and a key to your door

Sara, oh Sara
Glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow
Sara, oh Sara
Don’t ever leave me, don’t ever go2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Bob Dylan’s 115th Dream,"I was riding on the Mayflower
When I thought I spied some land
Start again
Wait a minute now
Okay, take two

I was riding on the Mayflower
When I thought I spied some land
I yelled for Captain Arab
I have you understand
Who came running to the deck
Said, ""Boys, forget the whale
Look on over yonder
Cut the engines
Change the sail
Haul on the bowline""
We sang that melody
Like all tough sailors do
When they're far away at sea

""I think I'll call it America""
I said as we hit land
I took a deep breath
I fell down, I could not stand
Captain Arab he started
Writing up some deeds
He said, ""Let's set up a fort
And start buyin' a place with beads""
Just then this cop comes down the street
Crazy as a loon
He throws us all in jail
For carrying harpoons
Ah, me I busted out
Don't even ask me how
I went to get some help
I walked by a Guernsey cow
Who directed me down
To the Bowery slums
Where people carried signs around
Sayin', ""Ban the bums""
I jumped right into line
Sayin' ""I hope that I'm not late""
When I realized I hadn't eaten
For five days straight

I went into a restaurant
Looking for the cook
I told him I was the editor
Of a famous etiquette book
The waitress he was handsome
He wore a powder blue cape
I ordered some Suzette, I said
""Could you please make that Crepe?""
Just then the whole kitchen exploded
From boilin' fat
Food was flyin' everywhere
I left without my hat
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy
But I went into a bank
To get some bail for Arab
And all the boys back in the tank
They asked me for some collateral
And I pulled down my pants
They threw me in the alley
When up comes this girl from France
Who invited me to her house
I went, but she had a friend
Who knocked me out
And robbed my boots
And I was on the street again

Well, I rapped upon a house
With the U.S. flag upon display
I said, ""Could you help me out
I got some friends down the way""
""The man says, ""Get out of here
I'll tear you limb from limb""
I said, ""You know they refused Jesus, too""
He said, ""You're not Him
Get out of here before I break your bones
I ain't your pop""
I decided to have him arrested
And I went lookin' for a cop
I ran right outside
I hopped inside a cab
I went out the other door
This Englishman said, ""Fab""
As he saw me leap a hot dog stand
And a chariot that stood
Parked across from a building
Advertising brotherhood
I ran right through the front door
Like a hobo sailor does
But it was just a funeral parlor
And the man asked me who I was

I repeated that my friends
Were all in jail, with a sigh
He gave me his card
He said, ""Call me if they die""
I shook his hand and said goodbye
Ran out to the street
When a bowling ball came down the road
And knocked me off my feet
A pay phone was ringing
And it just about blew my mind
When I picked it up and said hello
This foot came through the line

Well, by this time I's fed up
At tryin' to make a stab
At bringing back any help
For my friends and captain Arab
I decided to flip a coin
Like either heads or tails
Would let me know if I should go
Back to ship or back to jail
So I hocked my sailor suit
And I got a coin to flip
It came up tails
It rhymed with sails
So I made it back to the ship

Well, I got back and took
The parking ticket off the mast
I was ripping it to shreds
When this coastguard boat went past
They asked me my name
And I said, ""Captain Kidd""
They believed me but
They wanted to know
What exactly that I did
I said for the Pope of Eruke
I was employed
They let me go right away
They were very paranoid

Well, the last I heard of Arab
He was stuck on a whale
That was married to the deputy
Sheriff of the jail
But the funniest thing was
When I was leavin' the bay
I saw three ships sailin'
There were all heading my way
I asked the captain what his name was
And how come he didn't drive a truck
He said his name was Columbus
I just said, ""Good luck""1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
"Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts","The festival was over, and the boys were all planning for a fall
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down
Anyone with any sense had already left town
He was standing in the doorway looking like the Jack of Hearts

He moved across the mirrored room, “Set it up for everyone,” he said
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads
Then he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin
“Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?”
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the Jack of Hearts

Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs
Lily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide
A gentle breeze was blowing, you could feel it from inside
Lily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts

Big Jim was no one’s fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine
He made his usual entrance looking so dandy and so fine
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the Jack of Hearts
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town
She slipped in through the side door looking like a queen without a crown
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear
“Sorry, darling, that I’m late,” but he didn't seem to hear
He was staring into space over at the Jack of Hearts

“I know I’ve seen that face somewhere,” Big Jim was thinking to himself
“Maybe down in Mexico or a picture up on somebody’s shelf”
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights did dim
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him
Staring at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts

Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child
She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled
She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
With men in every walk of life which took her everywhere
But she’d never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts

The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined
The drilling in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind
It was known all around that Lily had Jim’s ring
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king
No, nothing ever would except maybe the Jack of Hearts
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife
She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim’s wife
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died
She was gazing to the future, riding on the Jack of Hearts

Lily took her dress off, buried it away
“Has your luck run out?” she laughed at him, “Well, I guess you must
Have known it would someday
Be careful not to touch the wall, there’s a brand-new coat of paint
I’m glad to see you’re still alive, you’re looking like a saint”
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the Jack of Hearts

The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair
“There’s something funny going on,” he said, “I can just feel it in the air”
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge was drunk
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk
There was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts

No one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick
The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked
And Big Jim was standing there, ya couldn't say surprised
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes
She was with Big Jim but she was leaning to the Jack of Hearts
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
And cleaned out the bank safe, it’s said that they got off with quite a haul
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
For one more member who had business back in town
But they couldn't go no further without the Jack of Hearts

The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink
The hanging judge was sober, he hadn't had a drink
The only person on the scene missing was the Jack of Hearts

The cabaret was empty now, a sign said, “Closed for repair”
Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair
She was thinking ’bout her father, who she very rarely saw
Thinking ’bout Rosemary and thinking about the law
But most of all she was thinking ’bout the Jack of Hearts6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
"It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry","Well, I ride on a mail train, baby
Can't buy a thrill
Well, I been up all night
Leanin' on the windowsill
Well, if I die
On top of the hill
And if I don’t make it
You know my baby will

Don't the moon look good, mama
Shining through the trees?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama
Flaggin' down the “Double E?”
Don't the sun look good
Goin' down over the sea?
But don’t my gal look fine
When she's comin' after me?

Now the wintertime is coming
The windows are filled with frost
I went to tell everybody
But I could not get across
Well, I want to be your lover, baby
I don’t want to be your boss
Don’t say I never warned you
When your train gets lost2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Mother of Muses,"Mother of Muses sing for me
Sing of the mountains and the deep dark sea
Sing of the lakes and the nymphs of the forest
Sing your hearts out, all your women of the chorus
Sing of honor and fate and glory be
Mother of Muses sing for me
Mother of Muses sing for my heart
Sing of a love too soon to depart
Sing of the heroes who stood alone
Whose names are engraved on tablets of stone
Who struggled with pain so the world could go free
Mother of Muses sing for me
Sing of Sherman, Montgomery, and Scott‬
And of Zhukov, and Patton, and the battles they fought
Who cleared the path for Presley to sing
Who carved the path for Martin Luther King
Who did what they did and they went on their way
Man, I could tell their stories all day
I'm falling in love with Calliope
She don't belong to anyone, why not give her to me?
She's speaking to me, speaking with her eyes
I've grown so tired of chasing lies
Mother of Muses, wherever you are
I've already outlived my life by far
Mother of Muses, unleash your wrath
Things I can't see, they're blocking my path
Show me your wisdom, tell me my fate
Put me upright, make me walk straight
Forge my identity from the inside out
You know what I'm talking about
Take me to the river, release your charms
Let me lay down a while in your sweet, loving arms
Wake me, shake me, free me from sin
Make me invisible, like the wind
Got a mind that ramble, got a mind that roam
I'm travelin' light and I'm a-slow coming homeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
4th Time Around,"When she said
“Don’t waste your words, they’re just lies”
I cried she was deaf
And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes
And said, “What else you got left?”
Yeah, it was then that I got up to leave
But she said, “Don’t forget
Everybody must give something back
For something they get”

I stood there and hummed
I tapped on her drum I asked her ""How come?""
And she buttoned her boot
And straightened her suit
Then she said, “Don’t get cute”
So I forced my hands in my pockets
And felt with my thumbs
And gallantly handed her
My very last piece of gum

She threw me outside
I stood in the dirt where everyone walked
And after finding out I’d
Forgotten my shirt
I went back and knocked
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it
And I tried to make sense
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair
That leaned up against
Her Jamaican rum
And when she did come, I asked her for some
She said, “No, dear”
I said, “Your words aren’t clear
You’d better spit out your gum”
She screamed 'til her face got so red
Then she fell on the floor
And I covered her up and then
Thought I’d go look through her drawer

And when I was through
I filled up my shoe
And brought it to you
And you, you took me in
You loved me then
You never wasted time
And I, I never took much
I never asked for your crutch
Now don’t ask for mine3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

And the smell of their roses does not remain

Have died in battle or in vain

At your feet to convince you of your pain
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic

Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?
Now when all of the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
All lay down their bandanas and complain
And you want somebody ya' don’t have to speak to

Crossing the Rubicon,"I crossed the Rubicon on the 14th day
Of the most dangerous month of the year
At the worst time, at the worst place
That's all I seem to hear
I got up early
So I can greet the goddess of the dawn
I've painted my wagon, abandoned all hope
And I crossed the Rubicon

Well, the Rubicon is a red river
Goin' gently as she flows
Redder than your ruby lips
And the blood that flows from the rose
Three miles north of purgatory
One step from the great beyond
I prayed to the cross, I kissed the girls
And I crossed the Rubicon

What are these dark days I see?
In this world so badly bent
I cannot redeem the time
The time so idly spent
How much longer can it last?
How long can it go on?
I embrace my love, put down my hair
And I crossed the Rubicon
I can feel the bones beneath my skin
And they're tremblin' with rage
I'll make your wife a widow
You'll never see old age
Show me one good man in sight
That the sun shines down upon
I pawned my watch, I paid my debts
And I crossed the Rubicon

Put my hide up on a hill
Where some happiness I'll find
If I survive, then let me love
Let the hour be mine
Take the high road, take the low
Take any one you're on
I poured the cup, I passed it along
And I crossed the Rubicon

Well, you defiled the most lovely flowers
In all her womanhood
Others can be tolerant
Others can be good
I'll cut you up with a crooked knife
Lord, and I'll miss you when you're gone
I stood between Heaven and Earth
And I crossed the Rubicon
You won't find any happiness here
No happiness or joy
Go back to the gutter, try your luck
Find you some nice pretty boy
Tell me how many men I need
And who can I count upon
I strapped my belt, I buttoned my coat
And I crossed the Rubicon

I feel the holy spirit inside
See the light that freedom gives
I believe it's in the reach of
Every man who lives
Keep as far away as possible
It's darkest 'fore the dawn (Oh Lord)
I turned the key, I broke it off
And I crossed the Rubicon

Mona, baby, are you still in my mind?
I truly believe that you are
Couldn't be anybody else but you
Who's come with me this far
The killing frost is on the ground
And the autumn leaves are gone
I lit the torch, I looked to the east
And I crossed the RubiconEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Isis,"I married Isis on the fifth day of May
But I could not hold on to her very long
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
For the wild unknown country where I could not go wrong

I came to a high place of darkness and light
Dividing line ran through the center of town
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down

A man in the corner approached me for a match
I knew right away, he was not ordinary
He said “Are you looking for something easy to catch?”
Said “I got no money”
He said “That ain't necessary”

We set out that night, for the cold in the North
I gave him my blanket, and he gave me his word
I said “Where are we going?” He said we’d be back by the fourth
I said “That’s the best news that I’ve ever heard”

I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold
I was thinking about diamonds, and the world’s biggest necklace
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
And things would be different the next time we wed
If I only could hang on and just be her friend
I still can’t remember all the best things she said

We came to the pyramids, all embedded in ice
He said “There’s a body I’m trying to find
If I carry it out it’ll bring a good price”
'Twas then that I knew what he had on his mind

The wind it was a-howlin', and the snow was outrageous
We chopped through the night
And we chopped through the dawn
When he died I was hoping that it wasn’t contagious
But I made up my mind that I had to go on

I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty
There was no jewels, no nothing! I felt I’d been had
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly
When I took up his offer I must've been mad

I picked up his body and I dragged him inside
Threw him down in the hole, and I put back the cover
I said a quick prayer, then I felt satisfied
Then I rode back to find Isis, just to tell her I love her
She was there in the meadow, where the creek used to rise
Blinded by sleep, and in need of a bed
I came in from the East, with the sun in my eyes
I cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead

She said “Where you been?” I said “No place special”
She said “You look different” I said “Well... I guess”
She said “You been gone” I said “That’s only natural”
She said “You going to stay?” I said “If you want me to, yes""

Isis, oh, Isis, you mystical child
What drives me to you is what drives me insane
I still can remember the way that you smiled
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Girl from the North Country (Duet),"If you’re travelin' to the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline

It curls and falls all down her breast
See for me that her hair's hangin' down

When the rivers freeze and summer ends

Buckets of moonbeams in my hand

And hard like an oak

Little red bike

I like the way you love me strong and slow
I’m taking you with me
Honey baby, when I go
Life is sad
Life is a bust
All you can do is do what you must
You do what you must do, and you do it well
I do it for you
Honey baby, can’t you tell?9EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Pay in Blood,"Well I'm grinding my life out, steady and sure
Nothing more wretched than what I must endure
I'm drenched in the light that shines from the sun
I could stone you to death for the wrongs that you done
Sooner or later you make a mistake
I'll put you in a chain that you never will break
Legs and arms and body and bone
I pay in blood, but not my own

Night after night, day after day
They strip your useless hopes away
The more I take the more I give
The more I die the more I live
I got something in my pocket make your eyeballs swim
I got dogs could tear you limb from limb
I'm circling around the Southern Zone
I pay in blood, but not my own

Low cards are what I've got
But I'll play this hand whether I like it or not
I'm sworn to uphold the laws of God
You could put me out in front of a firing squad
I've been out and around with the rowdy men
Just like you, my handsome friend
My head's so hard, must be made of stone
I pay in blood, but not my own
Another politician pumping out the piss
Another angry beggar blowing you a kiss
You got the same eyes that your mother does
If only you could prove who your father was
Someone must have slipped a drug in your wine
You gulped it down and you cross the line
Man can't live by bread alone
I pay in blood, but not my own

How I made it back home, nobody knows
Or how I survived so many blows
I've been through hell, what good did it do?
You bastard! I'm suppose to respect you?
I'll give you justice, I'll fatten your purse
Show me your moral virtues first
Hear me holler and hear me moan
I pay in blood but not my own
You pet your lover in the bed
Come here, I'll break your lousy head
Our nation must be saved and freed
You've been accused of murder, how do you plead?
This is how I spend my days
I came to bury, not to praise
I'll drink my fill and sleep alone
I pay in blood, but not my own5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
The Man in Me,"The man in me will do nearly any task
And as for compensation, there’s little he would ask
Take a woman like you
To get through to the man in me

Storm clouds are raging all around my door
I think to myself I might not take it anymore
Take a woman like your kind
To find the man in me

But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
Just to know that you are near
Sets my heart a-reeling
From my toes up to my ears

The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from bein’ seen
But that’s just because he doesn’t want to turn into some machine
Took a woman like you
To get through to the man in me5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Not Dark Yet,"Shadows are falling
And I’ve been here all day
It’s too hot to sleep
And time is running away
Feel like my soul has
Turned into steel
I’ve still got the scars
That the sun didn’t heal
There’s not even room enough
To be anywhere

It’s not dark yet
But it’s getting there

Well, my sense of humanity
Has gone down the drain
Behind every beautiful thing
There’s been some kind of pain
She wrote me a letter
And she wrote it so kind
She put down in writing
What was in her mind
I just don’t see why I should even care
It’s not dark yet
But it’s getting there

Well, I’ve been to London
And I’ve been to gay Paris
I’ve followed the river
And I got to the sea
I’ve been down on the bottom
Of a world full of lies
I ain’t looking for nothing
In anyone’s eyes
Sometimes my burden
Is more than I can bear

It’s not dark yet
But it’s getting there


I was born here, and I’ll die here
Against my will
I know it looks like I’m moving
But I’m standing still
Every nerve in my body
Is so vacant and numb
I can’t even remember what it was
I came here to get away from
Don’t even hear a murmur of a prayer
It’s not dark yet
But it’s getting there11EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Only a Pawn in Their Game,"A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers’ blood
A finger fired the trigger to his name
A handle hid out in the dark
A hand set the spark
Two eyes took the aim
Behind a man’s brain
But he can’t be blamed
He’s only a pawn in their game
A South politician preaches to the poor white man
“You got more than the blacks, don’t complain
You’re better than them, you been born with white skin,” they explain
And the Negro’s name
Is used it is plain
For the politician’s gain
As he rises to fame
And the poor white remains
On the caboose of the train
But it ain't him to blame
He’s only a pawn in their game
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid
And the marshals and cops get the same
But the poor white man’s used in the hands of them all like a tool
He’s taught in his school
From the start by the rule
That the laws are with him
To protect his white skin
To keep up his hate
So he never thinks straight
'Bout the shape that he’s in
But it ain't him to blame
He’s only a pawn in their game
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
And the hoof beats pound in his brain
And he’s taught how to walk in a pack
Shoot in the back, with his fist in a clinch
To hang and to lynch
To hide 'neath the hood
To kill with no pain
Like a dog on a chain
He ain't a-got no name
But it ain't him to blame
He’s only a pawn in their game
Today, Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught
They lowered him down as a king
But when the shadowy sun sets on the one
That fired the gun
He’ll see by his grave
On the stone that remains
Carved next to his name
His epitaph plain
Only a pawn in their game4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Leopard-Skin Pill Box Hat,"Well, I see you got your
Brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat
Yes, I see you got your
Brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat
Well, you must tell me, baby
How your head feels under something like that
Under your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat

Well, you look so pretty in it
Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Yes, I just wanna see
If it's really the expensive kind
You know it balances on your head

On a bottle of wine
Your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat

Well, if you want to see the sun rise
Honey, I know where
We'll go out and see it sometime
We'll both just sit there and stare
Me with my belt wrapped around my head
And you just sittin' there
In your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat

Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you
""It's bad for your health,"" he said
Yes, I disobeyed his orders
I came to see you, but I found him there instead
You know, I don't mind you cheatin' on me
But I sure wish he'd take that off his head
Your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat

Well, I see you got a new boyfriend
You know, I never seen him before
Well, I saw you makin' love with him
You forgot to close the garage door
You might think he loves you for your money
But I know what he really loves you for

The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll,"William Zanzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
With a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger
At a Baltimore hotel society gatherin'
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
As they rode him in custody down to the station
And booked William Zanzinger for first-degree murder
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face
Now ain't the time for your tears
William Zanzinger, who at twenty-four years
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres
With rich wealthy parents who provide and protect him
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
And swear words and sneering, and his tongue it was a-snarling
And in a matter of minutes on bail was out walking
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears
Take the rag away from your face
Now ain't the time for your tears
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
And never sat once at the head of the table
And didn’t even talk to the people at the table
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
That sailed through the air and came down through the room
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle
And she never done nothin' to William Zanzinger
And you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face
Now ain't the time for your tears
In the courtroom of honor, the judge pounded his gavel
To show that all’s equal and that the courts are on the level
And that the strings in the books ain’t pulled and persuaded
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Once that the cops have chased after and caught ’em
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom
Stared at the person who killed for no reason
Who just happened to be feelin' that way without warnin'
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished
And handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance
William Zanzinger with a six-month sentence
Ah, but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
Bury the rag deep in your face
For now’s the time for your tears4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Scarlet Town,"In Scarlet Town, where I was born
There’s ivy leaf and silver thorn
The streets have names that you can’t pronounce
Gold is down to a quarter of an ounce
The music starts and the people sway
Everybody says, “Are you going my way?""
Uncle Tom still working' for Uncle Bill
Scarlet Town is under the hill

Scarlet Town in the month of May
Sweet William Holme on his deathbed lay
Mistress Mary by the side of the bed
Kissing' his face and putting' prayers on his head
So brave and true, so gentle is he
I’ll weep for him as he would weep for me
Little Boy Blue come blow your horn
In Scarlet Town, where I was born

Scarlet Town, in the hot noon hours
There’s palm-leaf shadows and scattered flowers
Beggars crouching at the gate
Help comes, but it comes too late
By marble slabs and in fields of stone
You make your humble wishes known
I touched the garment, but the hem was torn
In Scarlet Town, where I was born
In Scarlet Town, the end is near
The Seven Wonders of the World are here
The evil and the good living' side by side
All human forms seem glorified
Put your heart on a platter and see who will bite
See who will hold you and kiss you good night
There’s walnut groves and maplewood
In Scarlet Town crying' won’t do no good

In Scarlet Town, you fight your father’s foes
Up on the hill, a chilly wind blows
You fight ‘em on high and you fight 'em down in
You fight 'em with whiskey, morphine and gin
You’ve got legs that can drive men mad
A lot of things we didn’t do that I wish we had
In Scarlet Town, the sky is clear
You’ll wish to God that you stayed right here

Set ‘em Joe, play “Walking the Floor""
Play it for my flat-chested junkie whore
I’m staying up late, I’m making amends
While we smile, all heaven descends
If love is a sin, then beauty is a crime
All things are beautiful in their time
The black and the white, the yellow and the brown
It’s all right there in front of you in Scarlet TownEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
I Shall Be Released,"They say every man must need protection
They say every man must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Some place so high above the wall

I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
There's a man who swears he's not to blame
All day long I hear him cry so loud
Calling out that he's been framed
Yeah

I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released7EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Things Have Changed,"A worried man with a worried mind
No one in front of me and nothing behind
There’s a woman on my lap and she’s drinking champagne
Got white skin, got assassin’s eyes
I’m looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies
I’m well dressed, waiting on the last train
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose
Any minute now I’m expecting all hell to break loose

People are crazy and times are strange
I’m locked in tight, I’m out of range
I used to care, but things have changed

This place ain’t doing me any good
I’m in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag
Ain’t no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag
Only a fool in here would think he’s got anything to prove
Lot of water under the bridge, lot of other stuff too
Don’t get up gentlemen, I’m only passing through

People are crazy and times are strange
I’m locked in tight, I’m out of range
I used to care, but things have changed
I’ve been walking forty miles of bad road
If the Bible is right, the world will explode
I’ve been trying to get as far away from myself as I can
Some things are too hot to touch
The human mind can only stand so much
You can’t win with a losing hand
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet
Putting her in a wheelbarrow and wheeling her down the street

People are crazy and times are strange
I’m locked in tight, I’m out of range
I used to care, but things have changed

I hurt easy, I just don’t show it
You can hurt someone and not even know it
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity
Gonna get low down, gonna fly high
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie
I’m in love with a woman who don’t even appeal to me
Mr. Jinx and Miss Lucy, they jumped in the lake
I’m not that eager to make a mistake

People are crazy and times are strange
I’m locked in tight, I’m out of range
I used to care, but things have changed5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
I Shall Be Free,"Well, I took me a woman late last night
I’s three-fourths drunk, she looked alright
'Til she started peeling off her onion gook
Took off her wig, said, “How do I look?""
I's high flying, bare-naked
Out the window

Well, sometimes I might get drunk
Walk like a duck and smell like a skunk
Don’t hurt me none, it don’t hurt my pride
Because I got my little lady right by my side
She's a tryin to hide, pretendin' she don't know me

I’s out there painting on the old woodshed
When a can of black paint, it fell on my head
I went down to scrub and rub
But I had to sit in back of the tub
Cost a quarter
Half price

Well, my telephone rang, it would not stop
It’s President Kennedy calling me up
He said, “My friend, Bob
What do we need to make the country grow?”
I said, “My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot
Anita Ekberg
Sophia Loren”
Country'll grow
Well, I got a woman, five feet short
She yells and hollers and screams and snorts
She tickles my nose, pats me on the head
Rolls me over and kicks me out of bed
She’s a man-eater, meat-grinder, bad loser

Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time
I got a woman who works herself blind
Works up to her britches, up to her neck
Writes me letters and sends me checks
She’s a humdinger
Folk singer

Late one day in the middle of the week
Eyes were closed, I was half asleep
I chased me a woman up the hill
Right in the middle of an air-raid drill
I jumped a fallout shelter
I jumped a string bean
I jumped a TV dinner
I jumped a shotgun

Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote
He’s a-running for office on the ballot note
He’s out there preaching in front of the steeple
Telling me he loves all kinds of people
He’s eatin' bagels
He’s eatin' pizza
He’s eatin' chitlins
Oh, set me down on a television floor
I’ll flip the channel to number four
Out of the shower comes a football man
With a bottle of oil in his hand
Greasy kid stuff
What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is
What do you do about Willy Mays
Martin Luther King
Olatunji

Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean
She takes about fifteen baths a day
Wants me to grow a mustache on my face
She’s insane

Well, they ask me why I’m drunk all the time
It levels my head and eases my mind
I just walk along and stroll and sing
I see better days and I do better things
I catch dinosaurs
Make love to Elizabeth Taylor
Catch hell from Richard Burton6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
One Too Many Mornings,"Down the street the dogs are barkin'
And the day is a-gettin' dark
As the night comes in a-falling
The dogs will lose their bark
And the silent night will shatter
From the sounds inside my mind
Yes I’m one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind
From the crossroads of my doorstep
My eyes start to fade
And I turn my head back to the room
Where my love and I have laid
And I gaze back to the street
The sidewalk and the sign
And I’m one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind
It’s a restless hungry feeling
That don’t mean no one no good
When everything I’m a-sayin'
You can say it just as good
You’re right from your side
I'm right from mine
We’re both just one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
"Mama, You Been on My Mind","Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that
But mama you been on my mind

I don't mean trouble please don't put me down or get upset
I am not pleading, or saying I can't forget you
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet
Mama you been on my mind

Even though my eyes are hazy
And my thoughts they might be narrow
Where you been don't bother me
Or bring me down with sorrow
I don't even mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow
Mama you're just on my mind

I'm not asking you to say words like yes or no
Please, understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go
I'm just whispering to myself so I can't pretend that I don't know
Mama you are on my mind
When you wake up in the morning, baby look inside your mirror
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
As someone who has had you on his mind2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Tin Angel,"It was late last night when the boss came home
To a deserted mansion and a desolate throne
Servant said: “Boss, the lady’s gone
She left this morning just ‘fore dawn.”

“You got something to tell me, tell it to me, man
Come to the point as straight as you can”
“Old Henry Lee, chief of the clan
Came riding through the woods and took her by the hand”

The boss he lay back flat on his bed
He cursed the heat and he clutched his head
He pondered the future of his fate
To wait another day would be far too late

“Go fetch me my coat and my tie
And the cheapest labour that money can buy
Saddle me up my buckskin mare
If you see me go by, put up a prayer”

Well, they rode all night, and they rode all day
Eastward, long down the broad highway
His spirit was tired and his vision was bent
His men deserted him and onward he went
He came to a place where the light was dull
His forehead pounding in his skull
Heavy heart was racked with pain
Insomnia raging in his brain

Well, he threw down his helmet and his cross-handled sword
He renounced his faith, he denied his lord
Crawled on his belly, put his ear to the wall
One way or another put an end to it all

He leaned down, cut the electric wire
Stared into the flames and he snorted the fire
Peered through the darkness, caught a glimpse of the two
It was hard to tell for certain who was who

He lowered himself down on a golden chain
His nerves were quaking in every vein
His knuckles were bloody, he sucked in the air
He ran his fingers through his greasy hair

They looked at each other and their glasses clinked
One single unit, inseparably linked
“Got a strange premonition there’s a man close by”
“Don’t worry about him, he wouldn’t harm a fly”
From behind the curtain, the boss he crossed the floor
He moved his feet and he bolted the door
Shadows hiding the lines in his face
With all the nobility of an ancient race

She turned, she was startled with a look of surprise
With a hatred that could hit the skies
“You’re a reckless fool, I could see it in your eyes
To come this way was by no means wise”

“Get up, stand up, you greedy-lipped wench
And cover your face or suffer the consequence
You are making my heart feel sick
Put your clothes back on, double-quick”

“Silly boy, you think me a saint
I’ll listen no more to your words of complaint
You’ve given me nothing but the sweetest lies
Now hold your tongue and feed your eyes”

“I’d have given you the stars and the planets, too
But what good would these things do you?
Bow the heart if not the knee
Or never again this world you’ll see”
“Oh, please let not your heart be cold
This man is dearer to me than gold”
“Oh, my dear, you must be blind
He’s a gutless ape with a worthless mind”

“You’ve had your way too long with me
Now it’s me who’ll determine how things shall be”
“Try to escape,” he cussed and cursed
‘You’ll have to try to get past me first”

“Do not let your passion rule
You think my heart the heart of a fool
And you, sir, you can not deny
You made a monkey of me, what and for why?”

“I’ll have no more of this insulting chat
The devil can have you, I’ll see to that
Look sharp or step aside
Or in the cradle you’ll wish you’d died”

The gun went boom and the shot rang clear
First bullet grazed his ear
Second ball went right straight in
And he bent in the middle like a twisted pin

He crawled to the corner and he lowered his head
He gripped the chair and he grabbed the bed
It would take more than needle and thread
Bleeding from the mouth, he’s as good as dead

“You shot my husband down, you fiend”
“Husband? What husband? What the hell do you mean?
He was a man of strife, a man of sin
I cut him down and threw him to the wind”

This she said with angry breath
“You too shall meet the lord of death
It was I who brought your soul to life”
Then she raised her robe and she drew out a knife

His face was hard and caked with sweat
His arms ached and his hands were wet
“You’re a murderous queen and a bloody wife
If you don’t mind, I’ll have the knife”

“We’re two of a kind and our blood runs hot
But we’re no way similar in body or thought
All husbands are good men, as all wives know”
Then she pierced him to the heart and his blood did flow

His knees went limp and he reached for the door
His tomb was sealed, he slid to the floor
He whispered in her ear: “This is all your fault
My fighting days have come to a halt”

She touched his lips and kissed his cheek
He tried to speak but his breath was weak
“You died for me, now I’ll die for you”
She put the blade to her heart and she ran it through

All three lovers together in a heap
Thrown into the grave, forever to sleep
Funeral torches blazed away
Through the towns and the villages all night and all dayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later),"I didn't mean to treat you so bad
You shouldn't take it so personal
I didn't mean to make you so sad
You just happened to be there, that's all

I thought that it was well understood
That you'd be comin' back in a little while
I didn't know that you were sayin' goodbye for good

But, sooner or later, one of us must know

Sooner or later, one of us must know

Your scarf had kept your mouth well hid
I couldn't see how you could know me
But you said you knew me and I believed you did
When you whispered in my ear
And asked me if I was leavin' with you or her
I didn't realize just what I did hear
I didn't realize how young you were
But, sooner or later, one of us must know
That you just did what you're supposed to do
Sooner or later, one of us must know
That I really did try to get close to you

And I couldn't see when it started snowin'
Your voice was all that I heard
I couldn't see where we were goin'
But you said you knew and I took your word
And then you told me later, as I apologized
That you were just kiddin' me, you weren't really from the farm
And I told you, as you clawed out my eyes
That I never really meant to do you any harm

But, sooner or later, one of us must know
That you just did what you're supposed to do
Sooner or later, one of us must know
That I really did try to get close to you6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Chimes of Freedom,"Far between sundown’s finish and midnight’s broken toll
We ducked inside the doorways, thunder went crashing
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds
Seemin' to be the chimes of freedom flashing
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

Through the city’s melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening
As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin’ rain
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake
Tolling for the luckless, they abandoned and forsaked
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze
Leavin' only bells of lightning and it's thunder
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind
And the poet and the painter far behind his rightful time
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
And the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
For disrobed faceless forms of no position
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts
All down in taken-for-granted situations
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute
For the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

Even though a cloud’s white curtain in a far-off corner flared
And the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
Condemned to drift or else be kept from driftin'
Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

Starry-eyed and laughing as I recall when we were caught
Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look
Spellbound and swallowed ’til the tolling ended
Tolling for the aching whose wounds cannot be nursed
For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Gates of Eden,"Of war and peace the truth just twists
It's curfew gull it glides
Upon four-legged forest clouds
The cowboy angel rides
With his candle lit into the sun
Though its glow is waxed in black
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden

The lamppost stands with folded arms
Its iron claws attached
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail
Though it shadows metal badge
All and all can only fall
With a crashing but meaningless blow
No sound ever comes from the Gates of Eden

The savage soldier sticks his head in sand
And then complains
Unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf
But still remains
Upon the beach where hound dogs bay
At ships with tattooed sails
Heading for the Gates of Eden
With a time-rusted compass blade
Aladdin and his lamp
Sits with Utopian hermit monks
Side saddle on the Golden Calf
And on their promises of paradise
You will not hear a laugh
All except inside the Gates of Eden

Relationships of ownership
They whisper in the wings
To those condemned to act accordingly
And wait for succeeding kings
And I try to harmonize with songs
The lonesome sparrow sings
There are no kings inside the Gates of Eden

The motorcycle Black Madonna
Two-wheeled gypsy queen
And her silver-studded phantom cause
The gray flannel dwarf to scream
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey
Who pick up on his bread crumb sins
And there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden
The kingdoms of experience
In the precious winds they rot
While paupers change possessions
Each one wishing for what the other has got
And the princess and the prince
Discuss what's real and what is not
It doesn't matter inside the Gates of Eden

The foreign sun, it squints upon
A bed that is never mine
As friends and other strangers
From their fates try to resign
Leaving men wholly totally free
To do anything they wish to do but die
And there are no trials inside the Gates of Eden

At dawn my lover comes to me
And tells me of her dreams
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
Into the ditch of what each one means
At times I think there are no words
But these to tell what's true
And there are no truths outside the Gates of Eden2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Meet Me in the Morning,"Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha
Honey, we could be in Kansas
By time the snow begins to thaw

They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn
But you wouldn’t know it by me
Every day’s been darkness since you been gone

Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind
Well, I feel just like that rooster
Honey, ya treat me so unkind

Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above
Well, you know I even outran the hound dogs
Honey, you know I’ve earned your love

Look at the sun sinking like a ship

Ain’t that just like my heart, babe
When you kissed my lips?2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Narrow Way,"I'm gonna walk across the desert 'til I'm in my right mind
I won't even think about what I left behind
Nothing back there anyway that I can call my own
Go back home, leave me alone
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

Ever since the British burned the White House down
There's a bleeding wound in the heart of town
I saw you drinking from an empty cup
I saw you buried and I saw you dug up
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

Look down angel from the skies
Help my weary soul to rise
I kissed her cheek I dragged your plow
You broke my heart, I was your friend 'til now
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

In the courtyard of the golden sun
You stand and fight or you break and run
You went and lost your lovely head
For a drink of wine and a crust of bread
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday
We looted and we plundered on distant shores
Why is my share not equal to yours
Your father left you, your mother too
Even death has washed its hands of you
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

This is hard country to stay alive in
Blades are everywhere and they're breaking my skin
I'm armed to the hilt and I'm struggling hard
You won't get out of here unscarred
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

You got too many lovers waiting at the wall
If I had a thousand tongues, I couldn't count them all
Yesterday I could've thrown them all in the sea
Today, even one, may be too much for me
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

Can't walk them, baby, you could do no wrong
Put your arms around me, where they belong
I won't take you on a roller-coaster ride
Lay my hands all over you, tie you to my side
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday
I've got a heavy stacked woman with a smile on her face
And she has crowned my soul with grace
Im still hurting from an arrow that pierced my chest
I'm gonna have to take my head and bury it between your breasts
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

Been dark all night but now it's dawn
The moving finger is moving on
You can guard me while I sleep
Kiss away the tears I weep
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

I love women and she loves men
We've been to the west and we going back again
I heard a voice at the dusk of day
Saying, ""Be gentle brother, be gentle and pray.""
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me somedayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Ballad of Hollis Brown,"Hollis Brown
He lived on the outside of town
Hollis Brown
He lived on the outside of town
With his wife and five children
And his cabin broken down

He looked for work and money
And he walked a ragged mile
He looked for work and money
And ya' walked a ragged mile
Your children are so hungry
That they don’t know how to smile

Your baby’s eyes look crazy
They’re a-tugging at your sleeve
Your baby’s eyes look crazy
They’re a-tugging at your sleeve
You walk the floor and wonder why
With every breath you breathe

The rats have got your flour
Bad blood it got your mare
The rats have got your flour
Bad blood it got your mare
If there’s anyone that knows
Is there anyone that cares?
He prayed to the Lord above
Oh please send you a friend
He prayed to the Lord above
Oh please send you a friend
Your empty pockets tell ya'
That you ain’t a-got no friend

Your babies are crying louder now
It’s a-poundin' on your brain
Your babies are crying louder now
It’s a-poundin' on your brain
Your wife’s screams are stabbin' ya'
Like the dirty drivin' rain

Your grass is turnin' black
There’s no water in your well
Your grass is turnin' black
There’s no water in your well
You spent your last lone dollar
On seven shotgun shells

Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
That’s hanging on the wall
Your brain is a-bleedin'
And your legs can’t seem to stand
Your brain is a-bleedin'
And your legs can’t seem to stand
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
That you’re holding in your hand

There’s seven breezes blowin'
All around the cabin door
There’s seven breezes blowin'
All around the cabin door
Seven shots ring out
Like the ocean’s poundin' roar

There’s seven people dead
On a South Dakota farm
There’s seven people dead
On a South Dakota farm
Somewheres in the distance
There’s seven new people born1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Mississippi,"Every step of the way we walk the line
Your days are numbered, so are mine
Time is piling’ up, we struggle and we scrape
We’re all boxed in, nowhere to escape

City’s just a jungle; more games to play
Trapped in the heart of it, trying' to get away
I was raised in the country, I been working’ in the town
I been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down

Got nothing' for you, I had nothing' before
Don’t even have anything for myself anymore
Sky full of fire, pain pouring’ down
Nothing you can sell me, I’ll see you around

All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
Could never do you justice in reason or rhyme
Only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long

Well, the devil’s in the alley, mule’s in the stall
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all
I was thinking’ 'bout the things that Rosie said
I was dreaming I was sleeping' in Rosie’s bed
Walking through the leaves, falling from the trees
Feeling like a stranger nobody sees
So many things that we never will undo
I know you’re sorry, I’m sorry too

Some people will offer you their hand and some won’t
Last night I knew you, tonight I don’t
I need something strong to distract my mind
I’m gonna look at you ’til my eyes go blind

Well I got here following' the southern star
I crossed that river just to be where you are
Only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long

Well my ship’s been split to splinters and it’s sinking' fast
I’m drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past
But my heart is not weary, it’s light and it’s free
I’ve got nothing but affection for all those who’ve sailed with me

Everybody moving if they ain’t already there
Everybody got to move somewhere
Stick with me baby, stick with me anyhow
Things should start to get interesting' right about now
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin
Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in
I know that fortune is waiting’ to be kind
So give me your hand and say you’ll be mine

Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay
You can always come back, but you can’t come back all the way
Only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
From a Buick 6,"I got this graveyard woman, you know
She keeps my kids
But my soulful mama, you know
She keeps me hid
She’s a junkyard angel, and she
Always gives me bread

Well, if I go down dyin', you know
She bound to put a blanket on my bed

Well, when the pipeline gets broken
And I'm lost on the river bridge
I’m all cracked up on the highway
And in the water’s edge
Here again she comes, down the thruway
Ready to sew me up with a thread

Well, if I go down dyin', you know
She bound to put a blanket on my bed

Well, she don’t make me nervous
She don’t talk too much
She walks like Bo Diddley
And she don’t need no crutch
She keeps this .410
All loaded with lead
Well, if I go down dyin', you know
She bound to put a blanket on my bed

Come on!

Well, you know I
Need a steam shovel, mama, to
Keep away the dead
I need a dump truck, baby, to
Unload my head
She brings me everything and more
And just like I said

Well, if I go down dyin', you know
She bound to put a blanket on my bed14EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
House of the Rising Sun,"There is a house down in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun.
And it's been the ruin of many a-poor girl
And me—oh, God—I'm one

My mother was a tailor
She sewed these new blue jeans
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord
Down in New Orleans

Now the only thing a gambler needs
Is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time he's satisfied
Is when he's on a drunk

He fills his glasses up to the brim
And he'll pass the cards around
And the only pleasure he gets out of life
Is ramblin' from town to town

Oh, tell my baby sister
Not to do what I have done!
But shun that house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
Well it's one foot on the platform
The other foot on the train!
I'm goin' back to New Orleans
To wear that ball and chain

I'm a goin' back to New Orleans
My race is almost run!
I'm goin' back to end my life
Down in the Rising Sun

There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
It's been the ruin of many a-poor girl
And me—oh, God—I'm one1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Bob Dylan’s Dream,"While riding on a train going west
I fell asleep for to take my rest
I dreamed a dream that made me sad
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had

With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon
Where we together weathered many a storm
Laughin and singin till the early hours of the morn

By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung
Our words was told, our songs was sung
Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied
Jokin' and talkin' about the world outside

With hungry hearts through the heat and cold
We never much thought we could get very old
We thought we could sit forever in fun
And our chances really was a million to one

As easy it was to tell black from white
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right
And our choices, they was few so the thought never hit
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split

How many a year has passed and gone
Many a gamble has been lost and won
And many a road taken by many a first friend
And each one I’ve never seen again


I wish, I wish, I wish in vain
That we could sit simply in that room again
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat
And I’d give it all gladly if our lives could be like that2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Soon After Midnight,"I'm searching for phrases
To sing your praises
I need to tell someone
It's soon after midnight
And my day has just begun

A gal named Honey
Took my money
She was passing by
It's soon after midnight
And the moon is in my eye

My heart is cheerful
It's never fearful
I've been down on the killing floors
I'm in no great hurry
I'm not afraid of your fury
I've faced stronger walls than yours

Charlotte's a harlot
Dresses in scarlet
Mary dresses in green
It's soon after midnight
And I've got a date with the fairy queen
They chirp and they chatter
What does it matter?
They're lying there dying in their blood
Two-timing Slim
Who's ever heard of him
I'll drag his corpse through the mud

It's now or never
More than ever
When I met you I didn't think you would do
It's soon after midnight
And I don't want nobody but you2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Changing of the Guards,"Sixteen years
Sixteen banners united over the fields
Where the good shepherd grieves
Desperate men, desperate women divided
Spreading their wings 'neath falling leaves

Fortune calls
I stepped forth from the shadows to the marketplace
Merchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down
She's smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born
On Midsummer's Eve near the tower

The cold-blooded moon
The captain waits above the celebration
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid
Whose ebony face is beyond communication
The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid

They shaved her head
She was torn between Jupiter and Apollo
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow
Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil
I stumbled to my feet
I rode past destruction in the ditches
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo
Renegade priests and treacherous young witches
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you

The palace of mirrors
Where dog soldiers are reflected
The endless road and the wailing of chimes
The empty rooms where her memory is protected
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times

She wakes him up
Forty-eight hours later the sun is breaking
Near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking
He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long golden locks

Gentlemen, he said I don't need your organization, I've shined your shoes
I've moved your mountains and marked your cards
But Eden is burning either get ready for elimination
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards
Peace will come
With tranquillity and splendor on the wheels of fire
But will offer no reward when her false idols fall
And cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating
Between the King and the Queen of Swords4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Oxford Town,"Oxford Town, Oxford Town
Everybody’s got their heads bowed down
The sun don’t shine above the ground
I am a-going down to Oxford Town

He went down to Oxford Town
Guns and clubs followed him down
All because his face was brown
Better get away from Oxford Town

Oxford Town around the bend
Come in to the door, he couldn’t get in
All because of the color of his skin
What do you think about that, my friend?

Me, my girl, my girl’s son
We got met with a tear gas bomb
I don’t even know why we come
Going back where we come from

Oxford Town in the afternoon
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune
Two men died beneath the Mississippi moon
Somebody better investigate soon1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Early Roman Kings,"All the early Roman Kings in their sharkskin suits
Bowties and buttons, high top boots
Driving the spikes in, blazing the rails
Nailed in their coffins in top hats and tails
Fly away little bird, fly away, flap your wings
Fly by night like the early Roman Kings

All the early Roman Kings in the early, early morn’
Coming down the mountain, distributing the corn
Speeding through the forest, racing down the track
You try to get away, they drag you back
Tomorrow is Friday, we’ll see what it brings
Everybody’s talking ‘bout the early Roman Kings

They’re peddlers and they’re meddlers, they buy and they sell
They destroyed your city, they’ll destroy you as well
They’re lecherous and treacherous, hell bent for leather
Each of them bigger than all men put together
Sluggers and muggers wearing fancy gold rings
All the women going crazy for the early Roman Kings

I'll dress up your wounds with a blood clotted rag
I ain’t afraid to make love to a bitch or a hag
If you see me coming and you’re standing there
Wave your handkerchief in the air
I ain’t dead yet, my bell still rings
I keep my fingers crossed like the early Roman Kings
I'll strip you of life, strip you of breath
Ship you down to the house of death
One day you will ask for me
There’ll be no one else that you’ll want to see
Bring down my fiddle, tune up my strings
Gonna break it wide open like the early Roman Kings

I was up on black mountain the day Detroit fell
They killed them all off and they sent them to hell
Ding Dong Daddy, you’re coming up short
Gonna put you on trial in a Sicilian court
I’ve had my fun, I’ve had my flings
Gonna shake ‘em all down like the early Roman Kings2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
To Ramona,"Ramona
Come closer
Shut softly your watery eyes
The pangs of your sadness
Will pass as your senses will rise
Oh the flowers of the city
Though breath-like
Get death-like at times
And there’s no use in trying
To deal with the dying
Though I cannot explain that in lines

Your cracked country lips
I still wish to kiss
As to be by the strength of your skin
Your magnetic movements
Still capture the minutes I’m in
But it grieves my heart, love
To see you trying to be a part of
A world that just don’t exist
It’s all just a dream, babe
A vacuum, a scheme, babe
That sucks you into feelin' like this
I can see that your head
Has been twisted and fed
With the worthless foam from the mouth
I can tell you are torn
Between staying and returning
Back to the South
You’ve been fooled into thinking
That the finishing end is at hand
Yet there’s no one to beat you
No one to defeat you
'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad

I’ve heard you say many times
That you’re better than no one
And no one is better than you
If you really believe that
You know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose
From fixtures and forces and friends
Your sorrow does stem
That hype you and type you
Making you feel
That you gotta' be just like them

I’d forever talk to you
But soon my words
Would turn into a meaningless ring
For deep in my heart
I know there's no help I can bring
Everything passes
Everything changes
Just do what you think you should do
And someday maybe
Who knows, baby
I’ll come and be crying to you2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
One More Cup of Coffee (Valley Below),"Your breath is sweet
Your eyes are like two jewels in the sky
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth
On the pillow where you lie
But I don't sense affection
No gratitude or love
Your loyalty is not to me
But to the stars above

One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below

Your daddy, he's an outlaw
And a wanderer by trade
He'll teach you how to pick and choose
And how to throw the blade
He oversees his kingdom
So no stranger does intrude
His voice, it trembles as he calls out
For another plate of food

One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below
Your sister sees the future
Like your mama and yourself
You've never learned to read or write
There's no books upon your shelf
And your pleasure knows no limits
Your voice is like a meadowlark
But your heart is like an ocean
Mysterious and dark

One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Long and Wasted Years,"It's been such a long, long time
Since we loved each other, when our hearts were true
One time, for one brief day
I was the man for you
Last night I heard you talking in your sleep
Saying things you shouldn't say, oh baby
You just may have to go to jail someday

Is there a place we can go?
Is there anybody we can see?
Maybe it's the same for you as it is for me
I ain't seen my family in twenty years
That ain't easy to understand
They may be dead by now
I lost track of 'em after they lost their land

Shake it up, baby, twist and shout
You know what it's all about
What are you doing out there in the sun anyway?
Don't you know, the sun can burn your brains right out
My enemy crashed into the dust
Stopped dead in his tracks and he lost his lust
He was run down hard and he broke apart
He died in shame, he had an iron heart

I wear dark glasses to cover my eyes
There are secrets in 'em that I can't disguise
Come back, baby
If I hurt your feelings, I apologize

Two trains running side by side
Forty miles wide, down the eastern line
You don't have to go
I just came to you because you're a friend of mine

I think that when my back was turned
The whole world behind me burned
It's been a while
Since we walked down that long, long aisle

We cried on a cold and frosty morn
We cried because our souls were torn
So much for tears
So much for these long and wasted yearsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

When the Ship Comes In,"Oh, the time will come up
When the winds will stop
And the breeze will cease to be breathin'
Like the stillness in the wind
Before the hurricane begins
The hour that the ship comes in
And the sea will split
And the ships will hit
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
Then the tide will sound
And the waves will pound
And the mornin' will be a-breakin'
The fishes will laugh
As they swim out of the path
And the seagulls, they'll be smilin'
And the rocks on the sand
Will proudly stand
The hour that the ship comes in
And the words that are used
For to get the ship confused
Will not be understood as they're spoken
For the chains of the sea
Will have busted in the night
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean
A song will lift
As the mainsail shifts
And the boat drifts on to the shoreline
And the sun will respect
Every face on the deck
The hour that the ship comes in
Then the sands will roll
Out a carpet of gold
For your weary toes to be a-touchin'
And the ship's wise men
Will remind you once again
That the whole wide world is watchin'
Oh, the foes will rise
With the sleep still in their eyes
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreamin'
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal
And they'll know that it's for real
The hour that the ship comes in
And they'll raise their hands
Sayin', ""We'll meet all your demands""
But we'll shout from the bow, ""Your days are numbered""
And like Pharoah's tribe
They'll be drowned in the tide
And like Goliath, they'll be conquered6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
The Death of Emmett Till (Witmark Demo - 1962),"T'was down in Mississippi, not so long ago
When a young boy from Chicago town stepped through a Southern door
This boy's dreadful tragedy I can still remember well
The color of his skin was black and his name was Emmett Till

Some men they dragged him to a barn and there they beat him up
They said they had a reason, but I can't remember what
They tortured him and did some things, too evil to repeat
There was screaming sounds inside the barn, there was laughing sounds out on the street

Then they rolled his body down a gulf, amidst a bloody red rain
And they threw him in the waters wide to cease his screaming pain
The reason that they killed him there, and I'm sure it ain't no lie
Was just for the fun of killing him and to watch him slowly die

And then to stop, the United States of yelling for a trial
Two brothers they confessed that they had killed poor Emmett Till
But on the jury there were men who helped the brothers commit this awful crime
And so this trial was a mockery, but nobody there seemed to mind

I saw the morning papers but I could not bear, to see
The smiling brothers walking' down the courthouse stairs
For the jury found them innocent, and the brothers they went free
While Emmett's body floats the foam of a Jim Crow southern sea
If you can't speak out against this kind of thing, a crime that's so unjust
Your eyes are filled with dead men's dirt, your mind is filled with dust
Your arms and legs they must be in shackles and chains, and your blood it must refuse to flow
For you to let this human race fall down so God-awful low!

This song's just a reminder to remind your fellow man
That this kind of thing still lives today in that ghost-robed Ku Klux Klan
But if all of us folks that thinks alike, if we give all we could give
We'd make this great land of ours a greater place to liveEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Song to Woody,"I’m out here a thousand miles from my home
Walking a road other men have gone down
I’m seeing your world of people and things
Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings
Hey, hey, Woody Guthrie, I wrote you a song
About a funny old world that’s a-coming along
Seems sick and it’s hungry, it’s tired and it’s torn
It looks like it’s a-dying and it’s hardly been born
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
All the things that I’m a-saying an a-many times more
I’m a-singing you the song, but I can’t sing enough
Because there’s not many men that done the things that you’ve done
Here’s to Cisco and Sonny and Leadbelly too
And to all the good people that traveled with you
Here’s to the hearts and the hands of the men
That come with the dust and are gone with the wind
I’m a-leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today
Somewhere down the road someday
The very last thing that I’d want to do
Is to say I’ve been hitting some hard traveling too3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Pledging My Time,"Well, early in the morning
'Til late at night
I got a poison headache
But I feel alright

I’m pledgin' my time to you
Hopin' you’ll come through, too

Well, the hobo got too high
And he came to me naturally
He stole my baby
Then he wanted to steal me

And I’m pledging my time to you
Hopin' you’ll come through, too

Won’t you come with me, baby?
I’ll take you where you want to go
And if it don’t work out
You’ll be the first to know
I’m pledging my time to you
Hopin' you’ll come through, too

Well, the room is so stuffy
I can hardly breathe
Everybody's gone, but me and you
And I can’t be the last to leave

I’m pledging my time to you
Hopin' you’ll come through, too

Well they sent for the ambulance
And one was sent
Somebody got lucky
But it was an accident

I’m pledging my time to you
Hopin' you’ll come through, too1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Most Likely You Go Your Way (And I’ll Go Mine),"You say you love me
And you're thinkin' of me
But you know you could be wrong
You say you told me
That you wanna hold me
But you know you're not that strong
I just can't do what I done before
I just can't beg you anymore
I'm gonna let you pass
And I'll go last
Then time will tell just who has fell
And who's been left behind
When you go your way and I go mine

You say you disturb me
And you don't deserve me
But you know sometimes you lie
You say you're shakin'
And you're always achin'
But you know how hard you try
Sometimes it gets so hard to care
It can't be this way everywhere
And I'm gonna let you pass
Yes, and I'll go last
Then time will tell who has fell
And who's been left behind
When you go your way and I go mine
Well the, the judge he holds a grudge
He's gonna call on you
But he's badly built
And he walks on stilts
Watch out he don't fall on you

You say you're sorry
For tellin' stories
That you know I believe are true
You say you got some
Other kinda lover
And yes, I believe you do
Say my kisses are not like his
But this time I'm not gonna tell you why that is
I'm just gonna let you pass
Yes, and I'll go last
Then time will tell who has fell
And who's been left behind
When you go your way and I go mine1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Tomorrow Is a Long Time,"If today was not a crooked highway
If tonight was not a crooked trail
If tomorrow wasn’t such a long time
Then lonesome would mean nothing to you at all
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
And if I could hear her heart a-softly pounding
Yes, and only if she was lying by me
Then I’d lie in my bed once again....

I can’t see my reflection in the waters
I can’t speak the sounds that show no pain
I can’t hear the echo of my footsteps
Or can’t remember the sound of my own name
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
And if I could hear her heart a-softly pounding
Yes, and only if she was lying by me
Then I’d lie in my bed once again...

There’s beauty in that silver, singing river
There’s beauty in the sunrise in the sky
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
That I remember in my true love’s eyes
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
And if I could hear her heart a-softly pounding
Yes, and only if she was lying by me
Then I’d lie in my bed once again...1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
North Country Blues,"Come an' gather 'round friends
And I'll tell ya' a tale
Of when the red iron ore pits ran a-plenty
But the cardboard filled windows
And old men on the benches
Tell you now that the whole town is empty
In the north end of town
My own children are grown
Well I was raised on the other
In the wee hours of youth
My mother took sick
And I was brought up by my brother
The iron ore poured
As the years passed the door
The drag lines and the shovels they was a-hummin'
'Til one day my brother
Failed to come home
The same as my father before him
Well a long winter's wait
From the winda' I watched
My friends they couldn'ta been kinder
And my school it was cut
As I quit in the spring
To marry John Thomas, a miner
Oh the years passed again
And the givin' was good
With the lunch bucket filled every season
What with three babies born
The work was cut down
To a half a day's shift with no reason
Then the shaft was soon shut
And more work was cut
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
'Til a man come to speak
And he said in one week
That number eleven was closin'
They complained in the East
They're payin' too high
They say that your ore ain't worth a-diggin'
That it's much cheaper down
In the South American towns
Where the miners work almost for nothin'
So the minin' gates locked
And the red iron rotted
And the room smelled heavy from drinkin'
When the sad silent song
Made the hour twice as long
As I waited for the sun to go sinking
I lived by the window
As he talked to himself
This silence of tongues it was buildin'
'Til one morning's wake
The bed it was bare
And I's left alone with three children
The summer is gone
The ground's turning cold
The stores one by one they're a-foldin'
My children will go
As soon they grow
Well there ain't nothin' here now to hold them1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
When I Paint My Masterpiece,"Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble
Ancient footprints are everywhere
You can almost think that you’re seeing double
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room
Where I’ve got me a date with Botticelli’s niece
She promised that she’d be right there with me
When I paint my masterpiece

Oh, the hours I’ve spent inside the Coliseum
Dodging lions and wasting time
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see them
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
When I ran on the hilltop following a pack of wild geese
Someday, everything is going to be smooth like a rhapsody
When I paint my masterpiece

Sailing 'round the world in a dirty gondola
Oh, to be back in the land of Coca-Cola

Well, I left Rome and landed in Brussels
On a plane ride so bumpy that I almost cried
Clergymen in uniform and young girls pulling mussels
Everyone was there to greet me when I stepped inside
Newspapermen eating candy
Had to be held down by big police
Someday, everything is going to be different
When I paint my masterpiece2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Romance in Durango,"Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun
Dust on my face and my cape
Me and Magdalena on the run
I think this time we shall escape
Sold my guitar to the baker’s son
For a few crumbs and a place to hide
But I can get another one
And I’ll play for Magdalena as we ride

No Ilores, mi querida
Dios nos vigila
Soon the horse will take us to Durango
Agarrame, mi vida
Soon the desert will be gone
Soon you will be dancing the fandango

Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people
Hoof beats like castanets on stone
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple
Then I see the bloody face of Ramon
Was it me that shot him down in the Cantina
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena
The dogs are barking and what’s done is done
No Ilores, mi querida
Dios nos vigila
Soon the horse will take us to Durango
Agarrame, mi vida
Soon the desert will be gone
Soon you will be dancing the fandango

In the corrida we’ll sit in the shade
And watch the young torero stand alone
We’ll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
When they rode with Villa into Torreón
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
In the little church this side of town
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold
You’ll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown
The way is long but the end is near
Already the fiesta has begun
The face of God will appear
With His serpent eyes of obsidian

No Ilores, mi querida
Dios nos vigila
Soon the horse will take us to Durango
Agarrame, mi vida
Soon the desert will be gone
Soon you will be dancing the fandango
Was that the thunder that I heard?
My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain
Come sit by me, don’t say a word
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun
Look up in the hills, that flash of light
Aim well my little one
We may not make it through the night

No Ilores, mi querida
Dios nos vigila
Soon the horse will take us to Durango
Agarrame, mi vida
Soon the desert will be gone
Soon you will be dancing the fandangoEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Love Sick,"I’m walking through streets that are dead
Walking, walking with you in my head
My feet are so tired, my brain is so wired
And the clouds are weeping

Did I hear someone tell a lie?
Did I hear someone’s distant cry?
I spoke like a child; you destroyed me with a smile
While I was sleeping

I’m sick of love but I’m in the thick of it
This kind of love I’m so sick of it

I see, I see lovers in the meadow
I see, I see silhouettes in the window
I watch them ’till they’re gone and they leave me hanging on
To a shadow

I’m sick of love; I hear the clock tick
This kind of love; I’m lovesick
Sometimes the silence can be like the thunder
Sometimes I want to take to the road and plunder
Could you ever be true? I think of you
And I wonder

I’m sick of love; I wish I’d never met you
I’m sick of love; I’m trying to forget you

Just don’t know what to do
I’d give anything to be with you1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

One More Cup of Coffee,"Your breath is sweet
Your eyes are like two jewels in the sky
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth
On the pillow where you lie
But I don't sense affection
No gratitude or love
Your loyalty is not to me
But to the stars above
One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below
Your daddy he's an outlaw
And a wanderer by trade
He'll teach you how to pick and choose
And how to throw the blade
He oversees his kingdom
So no stranger does intrude
His voice it trembles as he calls out
For another plate of food
One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below
Your sister sees the future
Like your mama and yourself
You've never learned to read or write
There's no books upon your shelf
And your pleasure knows no limits
Your voice is like a meadowlark
But your heart is like an ocean
Mysterious and dark
One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley belowEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Joey,"Born in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in the year of who knows when
Opened up his eyes to the tune of an accordion
Always on the outside of whatever side there was
When they asked him why it had to be that way, “Well,” he answered
“Just because”
Larry was the oldest, Joey was next to last
They called Joe “Crazy,” the baby they called “Kid Blast”
Some say they lived off gambling and runnin’ numbers too
It always seemed they got caught between the mob and the men in blue

Joey, Joey
King of the streets, child of clay
Joey, Joey
What made them want to come and blow you away?

There was talk they killed their rivals, but the truth was far from that
No one ever knew for sure where they were really at
When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost hit the roof
He went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproof
The war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets
Joey and his brothers suffered terrible defeats
Till they ventured out behind the lines and took five prisoners
They stashed them away in a basement, called them amateurs
The hostages were trembling when they heard a man exclaim
“Let’s blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame”
But Joey stepped up, and he raised his hands, said, “We’re not those kind of men
It’s peace and quiet that we need to go back to work again”


The police department hounded him, they called him Mr. Smith
They got him on conspiracy, they were never sure who with
“What time is it?” said the judge to Joey when they met
“Five to ten,” said Joey. The judge says, “That’s exactly what you get”
He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich
They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike
His closest friends were black men because they seemed to understand
What it’s like to be in society with a shackle on your hand
When they let him out in ’71 he’d lost a little weight
But he dressed like Jimmy Cagney and I swear he did look great
He tried to find the way back into the life he left behind
To the boss he said, “I have returned and now I want what’s mine”


It was true that in his later years he would not carry a gun
“I’m around too many children,” he’d say, “they should never know of one”
Yet he walked right into the clubhouse of his lifelong deadly foe
Emptied out the register, said, “Tell them it was Crazy Joe”
One day they blew him down in a clam bar in New York
He could see it coming through the door as he lifted up his fork
He pushed the table over to protect his family
Then he staggered out into the streets of Little Italy


Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep
I heard his best friend Frankie say, “He is not dead, he’s just asleep”
Then I saw the old man’s limousine head back towards the grave
I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save
The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned
They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born
And someday if God’s in heaven overlooking His preserve
I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve

The Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas Priest,"Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest
They were the best of friends
So when Frankie Lee needed money one day
Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
And placed them on a footstool
Just above the plotted plain
Sayin', “Take your pick, Frankie Boy
My loss will be your gain”

Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down
And put his fingers to his chin
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him
His head began to spin
“Could ya please not stare at me like that?,” he said
“It’s just my foolish pride
But sometimes a man must be alone
And this is no place to hide”

Well, Judas, he just winked and said
“Alright, I’ll leave you here
But you’d better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want
Before they all disappear”
“I’m gonna start my pickin' right now
Just tell me where you’ll be”
Judas pointed down the road
And said, “Eternity!”
“Eternity?” said Frankie Lee
With a voice as cold as ice
“That’s right,” said Judas, “Eternity
Though you might call it ‘Paradise’”
“I don’t call it anything”
Said Frankie Lee with a smile
“All right,” said Judas Priest
“I’ll see you after a while”

Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down
Feeling low and mean
When just then a passin' stranger
Burst upon the scene
Saying, “Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler
Whose father's deceased?
Well, if you are, there’s a fellow callin' you down the road
And they say his name is Priest”

“Oh, yes, he is my friend”
Said Frankie Lee in fright
“I do recall him very well
In fact, he just left my sight”
“Yes, that’s the one,” said the stranger
As quiet as a mouse
“Well, my message is, he’s down the road
Stranded in a house”
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked
He dropped everything and ran
Until he came up to the spot
Where Judas Priest did stand
“What kind of house is this,” he said
“Where I have come to roam?”
“It’s not a house,” says Judas Priest
“It’s not a house, it’s a home”

Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled
He soon lost all control
Over ev’rything which he had made
While the mission bells did toll
He just stood there staring
At that big house as bright as any sun
With four and twenty windows
And a woman’s face in ev’ry one

Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee
With a soulful, bounding leap
And, foaming at the mouth
He began to make his midnight creep
For sixteen nights and days he raved
But on the seventeenth he burst
Into the arms of Judas Priest
Which is where he died of thirst
No one tried to say a thing
When they carried him out in jest
Except, of course, the little neighbor boy
Who carried him to rest
And he just walked along, alone
With his guilt so well concealed
And muttered underneath his breath
“Nothing is revealed”

Well, the moral of this story
The moral of this song
Is simply that one should never be
Where one does not belong
So when you see your neighbor carrying somethin'
Help him with his load
And don’t go mistaking Paradise
For that home across the roadEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Blind Willie McTell,"Seen the arrow on the doorpost
Saying, “This land is condemned
All the way from New Orleans
To Jerusalem”
I traveled through East Texas
Where many martyrs fell
And I know no one can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell

Well, I heard that hoot owl singing
As they were taking down the tents
The stars above the barren trees
Was his only audience
Them charcoal gypsy maidens
Can strut their feathers well
But nobody can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell

See them big plantations burning
Hear the cracking of the whips
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming
See the ghosts of slavery ships
I can hear them tribes moaning
Hear that undertaker’s bell
Nobody can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell
There’s a woman by the river
With some fine young handsome man
He’s dressed up like a squire
Bootlegged whiskey in his hand
There’s a chain gang on the highway
I can hear them rebels yell
And I know no one can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell

Well, God is in His heaven
And we all want what’s His
But power and greed and corruptible seed
Seem to be all that there is
I’m gazing out the window
Of the St. James Hotel
And I know no one can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Most of the Time,"Most of the time

I can follow the path, I can read the signs
Stay right with it when the road unwinds
I can handle whatever I stumble upon
I don’t even notice she gone
Most of the time

Most of the time
It’s well understood
Most of the time
I wouldn’t change it if I could
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone
I can survive, I can endure
And I don’t even think about her
Most of the time

Most of the time
My head is on straight
Most of the time
I’m strong enough not to hate
I don’t build up illusion ’till it makes me sick
I ain’t afraid of confusion no matter how thick
I can smile in the face of mankind
Don’t even remember what her lips felt like on mine
Most of the time
Most of the time
She ain’t even in my mind
I wouldn’t know her if I saw her
She’s that far behind
Most of the time
I can’t even be sure
If she was ever with me
Or if I was ever with her

Most of the time
I’m halfway content
Most of the time
I know exactly where it all went
I don’t cheat on myself, I don’t run and hide
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside
I don’t compromise and I don’t pretend
I don’t even care if I ever see her again

"Oh, Sister","Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms
You should not treat me like a stranger
Our Father would not like the way that you act
And you must realize the danger

Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you
And one deserving of affection?
And is our purpose not the same on this earth
To love and follow His direction?

We grew up together
From the cradle to the grave
We died and were reborn
And then mysteriously saved

Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door
Don’t turn away, you’ll create sorrow
Time is an ocean but it ends at the shore
You may not see me tomorrow5EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Kneeling ’neath your ceiling
Yes, I guess I’ll be here for a while
I’m trying to read your poetry, but
I’m helpless, like a rich man’s child
How come you send someone out to have me barred?

You know I want your lovin’
Honey, why you so hard?

Like a poor fool in his prime
Yes, I know you can hear me walk
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime?
Or is it just solid rock?
Well, I lean into your hallway
Lean against your velvet door
I watch upon your scorpion
Who crawls across your circus floor
Just what do you think you have to guard?

You know I want your lovin’
Honey, but you’re so hard

Achilles is in your alleyway
He don’t want me here, he does brag
He’s pointing to the sky
And he’s hungry, like a man in drag
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?

You know I want your lovin'

The pistols are poppin' and the power is down
I'd like to try something' but I'm so far from town

I've been sitting down studying the art of love
I think it will fit me like a glove
I want some real good woman to do just what I say
Everybody got to wonder
What's the matter with this cruel world today

Thunder on the mountain rolling to the ground
Gonna get up in the morning walk the hard road down
Some sweet day I'll stand beside my king
I wouldn't betray your love or any other thing

Gonna raise me an army, some tough sons of bitches
I'll recruit my army from the orphanages
I been to St. Herman's church and I've said my religious vows
I've sucked the milk out of a thousand cows

I got the porkchops, she got the pie
She ain't no angel and neither am I
Shame on your greed, shame on your wicked schemes
I'll say this, I don't give a damn about your dreams

Thunder on the mountain heavy as can be
Mean old twister bearing down on me
All the ladies of Washington scrambling to get out of town
Looks like something bad gonna happen
Better roll your airplane down
Everybody's going and I want to go too
Don't wanna take a chance with somebody new
I did all I could and I did it right there and then
I've already confessed, no need to confess again

Gonna make a lot of money, gonna go up north
I'll plant and I'll harvest what the earth brings forth
The hammer's on the table, the pitchfork's on the shelf
For the love of God, you ought to take pity on yourself3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Bob Dylan’s Blues,"Unlike most of the songs nowadays that have been written up in Tin Pan Alley, that's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays, this, this is a song, this wasn't written up there, this was written somewhere down in the United States

Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto
They are riding down the line
Fixing everybody’s troubles
Everybody’s except mine
Somebody must have told them
That I was doing fine

Oh you five and ten cent women
With nothing in your heads
I got a real gal I’m loving
And Lord I’ll love her till I’m dead
Go away from my door and my window too
Right now

Lord, I am not going down to no race track
See no sports car run
I don’t have no sports car
And I don’t even care to have one
I can walk anytime around the block
Well, the wind keeps a-blowing me
Up and down the street
With my hat in my hand
And my boots on my feet
Watch out so you don’t step on me

Well, look it here buddy
You want to be like me
Pull out your six-shooter
And rob every bank you can see
Tell the judge I said it was all right
Yes!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Red River Shore,"Some of us turn off the lights and we live
With the moonlight shooting by
Some of us scare ourselves to death in the dark
To be where the angels fly
Pretty maids all in a row lined up
Outside my cabin door
I've never wanted any of them wanting me
Except the girl from the Red River Shore

Well, I sat by her side and for a while I tried
To make that girl my wife
She gave me her best advice and she said
Go home and lead a quiet life
Well, I been to the east and I been to the west
And I been out where the black winds roar
Somehow though I never did get that far
With the girl from the Red River Shore

Well, I knew when I first laid eyes on her
I could never be free
One look at her and I knew right away
She should always be with me
Well, the dream dried up a long time ago
Don't know where it is anymore
True to life, true to me
Was the girl from the Red River Shore
Well, I'm wearing the cloak of misery
And I've tasted jilted love
And the frozen smile upon my face
Fits me like a glove
Well, I can't escape from those memories
Of the one that I'll always adore
All those nights, when I lay in the arms
Of the girl from the Red River Shore

Well, we're living in the shadows of a fading past
Trapped in the fires of time
I'd tried not to ever hurt anybody
And to stay out of a life of crime
And when it's all been said and done
I never did know the score
One more day is another day away
From the girl from the Red River Shore

Well, I'm a stranger here in a strange land
But I know this is where I belong
I'll ramble and gamble for the one I love
And the hills will give me a song
Though nothing looks familiar to me
I know I've stayed here before
Once, a thousand nights ago
With the girl from the Red River Shore
Well, I went back to see about her once
Went back to straighten it out
Everybody that I talked to had seen us there
Said they didn't know who I was talking about
Well, the sun went down on me a long time ago
I had to go back from the door
I wish I could have spent every hour of my life
With the girl from the Red River Shore

Now I heard of a guy who lived a long time ago
A man full of sorrow and strife
That if someone around him died and was dead
He knew how to bring 'em on back to life
Well, I don't know what kind of language he used
Or if they do that kind of thing anymore
Sometimes I think nobody saw me here at all
Except the girl from the Red River Shore1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Ring Them Bells,"Ring them bells, ye heathen
From the city that dreams
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries
’Cross the valleys and streams
For they’re deep and they’re wide
And the world’s on its side
And time is running backwards
And so is the bride

Ring them bells St. Peter
Where the four winds blow
Ring them bells with an iron hand
So the people will know
Oh it’s rush hour now
On the wheel and the plow
And the sun is going down
Upon the sacred cow

Ring them bells Sweet Martha
For the poor man’s son
Ring them bells so the world will know
That God is one
Oh the shepherd is asleep
Where the willows weep
And the mountains are filled
With lost sheep

Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf
Ring them bells for all of us who are left
Ring them bells for the chosen few
Who will judge the many when the game is through
Ring them bells, for the time that flies
For the child that cries
When innocence dies

Ring them bells St. Catherine
From the top of the room
Ring them from the fortress
For the lilies that bloom
Oh the lines are long
And the fighting is strong
And they’re breaking down the distance
Between right and wrongEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Man in the Long Black Coat,"Crickets are chirping, the water is high
There’s a soft cotton dress on the line hangin’ dry
Window wide open, African trees
Bent over backwards from a hurricane breeze
Not a word of goodbye, not even a note
She gone with the man
In the long black coat

Somebody seen him hanging around
At the old dance hall on the outskirts of town
He looked into her eyes when she stopped him to ask
If he wanted to dance, he had a face like a mask
Somebody said from the Bible he’d quote
There was dust on the man
In the long black coat

Preacher was a talkin’, there’s a sermon he gave
He said every man’s conscience is vile and depraved
You cannot depend on it to be your guide
When it’s you who must keep it satisfied
It ain’t easy to swallow, it sticks in the throat
She gave her heart to the man
In the long black coat
There are no mistakes in life some people say
It is true sometimes you can see it that way
But people don't live or die, people just float
She went with the man
In the long black coat

There’s smoke on the water, it’s been there since June
Tree trunks uprooted, 'neath the high crescent moon
Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force
Somebody is out there beating a dead horse
She never said nothing, there was nothing she wrote
She gone with the man
In the long black coat3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
On the Road Again,"Well, I wake up in the morning
There's frogs inside my socks
Your mama, she's hidin'
Inside the icebox
Your daddy walks in wearin'
A Napoleon Bonaparte mask
Then you ask why I don't live here
Honey, do you have to ask?

Well, I go to pet your monkey
I get a face full of claws
I ask who's in the fireplace
And you tell me Santa Claus
The milkman comes in
He's wearing a derby hat
And you ask why I don't live here
Honey, how come you have to ask me that?

Well, I asked for somethin' to eat
I'm hungry as a hog
So I get brown rice, seaweed
And a dirty hot dog
I've got a hole
Where my stomach disappeared
Then you ask why I don't live here
Honey, I gotta' think you're really weird
Your grandpa's cane
It turns into a sword
Your grandma prays to pictures
That are pasted on a board
Everything inside my pockets
Your uncle steals
And you ask why I don't live here
Honey, I can't believe that you're for real

Well, there's fistfights in the kitchen
They're enough to make me cry
Little mailman comes in
Even he's got to take a side
Even the butler
He's got something to prove
Then you ask why I don't live here
Honey, how come you don't move?1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Standing in the Doorway,"I'm walking through the summer nights
The jukebox playing low
Yesterday everything was going too fast
Today it's moving too slow
I got no place left to turn
I got nothing left to burn
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow

You left me standing in the doorway, crying
I got nothing to go back to now

The light in this place is so bad
Making me sick in the head
All the laughter is just making me sad
The stars have turned cherry red
I'm strumming on my gay guitar
Smoking a cheap cigar
The ghost of our old love has not gone away
Don't look it like it will anytime soon

You left me standing in the doorway, crying
Under the midnight moon
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't
But not tonight and it won't be here
There are things I could say, but I don't
I know the mercy of God must be near
I've been riding a midnight train
Got ice water in my veins
I would be crazy if I took you back
It would go up against every rule

You left me standing in the doorway, crying
Suffering like a fool

When the last rays of daylight go down
Buddy, you’ll roll no more
I can hear the church bells ringing in the yard
I wonder who they're ringing for
I know I can't win
But my heart just won't give in
Last night I danced with a stranger
But she just reminded me you were the one

You left me standing in the doorway, crying
In the dark land of the sun
I eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry
And live my life on the square
And even if the flesh falls off of my face
I know someone will be there to care
It always means so much
Even the softest touch
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation
There's no words that need to be said

You left me standing in the doorway, crying
Blues wrapped around my head1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Dink’s Song,"If I had wings
Like Noah's Dove
I’d fly the river
To the one I love
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee well

I had a man
Who was long and tall
Moved his body
Like a cannonball
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee well

Remember one evening
Was drizzling rain
And around my heart
I felt an aching pain
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee well

Once I wore
My apron low
Couldn’t keep you
Away from my door
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee well
Now my apron
Is up to my chin
You pass my door
But you never come in
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee well

Oh, mighty river
Runs muddy and wild
Can’t care the bloody
For my unborn child
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee well

Number 9 train
Won’t do no harm
Number 9 train
Take my poor baby home
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee well

Fastest man
I ever saw
Skipped Missouri
On the way to Arkansas
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee wellEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Motorpsycho Nightmare,"I pounded on a farmhouse looking for a place to stay
I was mighty, mighty tired, I'd come a long, long way
I said, “Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?”
I was standin' on the steps feeling most alone
When out comes a farmer, he must've thought that I was nuts
He immediately looked at me and stuck a gun into my guts

I fell down to my bended knees
Saying, “I dig farmers, don’t shoot me, please!”
He cocked his rifle and begin to shout
“Are you that travelin' salesman that I have heard about?”
I said, “No! No! No! I’m a doctor and it’s true
I’m a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too”

Then in comes his daughter whose name was Rita
She looked like she stepped out of La Dolce Vita
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
And told him what a nice, pretty farm he had
He said, “What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?”
I said, “I's born at the bottom of a wishing well”

Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails, I guess he knew I wouldn’t lie
He said “I guess you’re tired,"" he said it kind of sly
I said, “Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove”
He said, “I got a bed for you underneath the stove
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now
That you don’t touch my daughter and in the morning, milk the cows”
I was sleeping like a rat when I heard something jerkin’
There stood Rita looking just like Tony Perkins
She said, “Would you like to take a shower? I’ll show you up to the door”
I said, “Oh, no, no, I’ve been through this movie before”
I knew I had to split but I did not know how
When she said “would you like to take that shower now?”

Well, I couldn’t leave unless the old man chased me out
Because I’d already promised that I’d milk his cows
I had to say somethin' to strike him very weird
So I yelled out “I like Fidel Castro and his beard”
Rita looked offended but she got out of the way
As he came charging down the stairs sayin', “What’s that I heard you say?”

I said, “I like Fidel Castro, I think you heard me right”
And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might
Rita mumbled somethin' 'bout her mother on the hill
As his fist it hit the icebox, he said he’s gonna kill me
If I don’t get out the door in two seconds flat
“You unpatriotic, rotten doctor Commie rat”

Well, he threw a Reader’s Digest at my head and I did run
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
And landed fully blast in his garden flowers
Rita said, “Come back!” as he started to load
The sun was coming up and I was running down the road
Well, I don’t figure I’ll be back there for a spell
Even though Rita moved away and got a job in a motel
He still waits for me, constant, on the sly
He wants to turn me in to the F.B.I
Me, I romp and stomping, thankful as I romp
Without freedom of speech, I might be in the swamp4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Every Grain of Sand,"In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed
There’s a dyin’ voice within me reaching out somewhere
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair

Don’t have the inclination to look back on any mistake
Like Cain, I now behold this chain of events that I must break
In the fury of the moment I can see the Master’s hand
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand

Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear
Like criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay

I gaze into the doorway of temptation’s angry flame
And every time I pass that way I always hear my name
Then onward in my journey I come to understand
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand

I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night
In the violence of a summer’s dream, in the chill of a wintry light
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea
Sometimes I turn, there’s someone there, other times it’s only me
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand

Farewell,"Oh it’s fare thee well my darling’ true
I’m leaving’ in the first hour of the morn
I’m bound off for the bay of Mexico
Or maybe the coast of Californ
So it’s fare thee well my own true love
We’ll meet another day, another time
It ain’t the leavin’
That’s a-grievin’ me
But my true love who’s bound to stay behind

Oh the weather is against me and the wind blows hard
And the rain she’s a-turnin’ into hail
I still might strike it lucky on a highway going’ west
Though I’m traveling’ on a path beaten trail
So it’s fare thee well my own true love
We’ll meet another day, another time
It ain’t the leaving’
That’s a-grievin’ me
But my true love who’s bound to stay behind

I will write you a letter from time to time
As I’m rambling’ you can travel with me too
With my head, my heart and my hands, my love
I will send what I learn back home to you
So it’s fare thee well my own true love
We’ll meet another day, another time
It ain’t the leaving’
That’s a-grievin’ me
But my true love who’s bound to stay behind
I will tell you of the laughter and of troubles
Be them somebody else’s or my own
With my hands in my pockets and my coat collar high
I will travel unnoticed and unknown
So it’s fare thee well my own true love
We’ll meet another day, another time
It ain’t the leaving
That’s a-grievin’ me
But my true love who’s bound to stay behind

I’ve heard tell of a town where I might as well be bound
It’s down around the old Mexican plains
They say that the people are all friendly there
And all they ask of you is your name
So it’s fare thee well my own true love
We’ll meet another day, another time
It ain’t the leaving
That’s a-grievin’ me
But my true love who’s bound to stay behindEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie,"I have a poem here. It's not a poem, it's... This is the first concert I played alone in New York, really. An a fellow in Brooklyn State Hospital, his name is Woody Guthrie. But Woody is more than a folk singer. He's really something else more than a folk singer and there's this book coming out that's dedicated to him. And they asked me to write something about Woody, like what does Woody mean to you in 25 words. And I couldn't do it, I wrote out 5 pages and I have it here. I have it here by accident actually. But I'd like to say this out loud. So this is my feelings towards Woody Guthrie. Cannot really be told in how many records of his I buy, it's a lot more than that actually. So if you can roll along with this thing here this is called ""Last Thoughts On Woody Guthrie""

When yer head gets twisted and yer mind grows numb
When you think you're too old, too young, too smart or too dumb
When yer laggin' behind an' losing yer pace
In a slow-motion crawl of life's busy race
No matter what yer doing if you start givin' up
If the wine don't come to the top of yer cup
If the wind's got you sideways with one hand holdin' on
And the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone
And yer train engine fire needs a new spark to catch it
And the wood's easy findin' but yer lazy to fetch it
And yer sidewalk starts curlin' and the street gets too long
And you start walkin' backwards though you know its wrong
And lonesome comes up as down goes the day
And tomorrow's morning seems so far away
And you feel the reins from yer pony are slippin'
And yer rope is a-slidin' cause yer hands are a-drippin'
And yer sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys
Turn to broken down slums and trash-can alleys
And yer sky cries water and yer drain pipe's a-pourin'
And the lightnin's a-flashing and the thunder's a-crashin'
And the windows are rattlin' and breakin' and the roof tops a-shakin'
And yer whole world's a-slamming  and banging
And yer minutes of sun turn to hours of storm
And to yourself you sometimes say
""I never knew it was gonna be this way
Why didn't they tell me the day I was born""
And you start gettin' chills and yer jumping from sweat
And you're looking for something you ain't quite found yet
And yer knee-deep in the dark water with yer hands in the air
And the whole world's a-watching with a window peek stare
And yer good gal leaves and she's long gone a-flying
And yer heart feels sick like fish when they're frying
And yer jackhammer falls from yer hand to yer feet
And you need it badly but it lays on the street
And yer bell's bangin' loudly but you can't hear its beat
And you think yer ears might a been hurt
Or yer eyes've turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt
And you figured you failed in yesterdays rush
When you were faked out an' fooled while facing a four flush
And all the time you were holdin' three queens
And it's making you mad, it's makin' you mean
Like in the middle of Life magazine
Bouncin' around a pinball machine
And there's something on yer mind you wanna be saying
That somebody someplace oughta be hearin'
But it's trapped on yer tongue and sealed in yer head
And it bothers you badly when you're laying in bed
And no matter how you try you just can't say it
And yer scared to yer soul you just might forget it
And yer eyes get swimmy from the tears in yer head
And yer pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead
And the lion's mouth opens and yer staring at his teeth
And his jaws start closing with you underneath
And yer flat on your belly with yer hands tied behind
And you wish you'd never taken that last detour sign
And you say to yourself just what am I doing
On this road I'm walkin', on this trail I'm turnin'
On this curve I'm hanging
On this pathway I'm strolling, in the space I'm taking
In this air I'm inhaling
Am I mixed up too much, am I mixed up too hard
Why am I walking, where am I running
What am I saying, what am I knowing
On this guitar I'm playing, on this banjo I'm frailin'
On this mandolin I'm strumming, in the song I'm singin'
In the tune I'm humming, in the words I'm writin'
In the words that I'm thinking
In this ocean of hours I'm all the time drinkin'
Who am I helping, what am I breaking
What am I giving, what am I taking
But you try with your whole soul best
Never to think these thoughts and never to let
Them kind of thoughts gain ground
Or make yer heart pound
But then again you know when they're around
Just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down
'Cause sometimes you hear'em when the night times comes creeping
And you fear that they might catch you a-sleeping
And you jump from yer bed, from yer last chapter of dreamin'
And you can't remember for the best of yer thinking
If that was you in the dream that was screaming
And you know that it's something special you're needin'
And you know that there's no drug that'll do for the healin'
And no liquor in the land to stop yer brain from bleeding
And you need something special
Yeah, you need something special all right
You need a fast flying train on a tornado track
To shoot you someplace and shoot you back
You need a cyclone wind on a stream engine howler
That's been banging and booming and blowing forever
That knows yer troubles a hundred times over
You need a Greyhound bus that don't bar no race
That won't laugh at yer looks
Your voice or your face
And by any number of bets in the book
Will be rolling long after the bubblegum craze
You need something to open up a new door
To show you something you seen before
But overlooked a hundred times or more
You need something to open your eyes
You need something to make it known
That it's you and no one else that owns
That spot that yer standing, that space that you're sitting
That the world ain't got you beat
That it ain't got you licked
It can't get you crazy no matter how many
Times you might get kicked
You need something special all right
You need something special to give you hope
But hope's just a word
That maybe you said or maybe you heard
On some windy corner 'round a wide-angled curve
But that's what you need man, and you need it bad
And yer trouble is you know it too good
'Cause you look an' you start getting the chills

'Cause you can't find it on a dollar bill
And it ain't on Macy's window sill
And it ain't on no rich kid's road map
And it ain't in no fat kid's fraternity house
And it ain't made in no Hollywood wheat germ
And it ain't on that dimlit stage
With that half-wit comedian on it
Ranting and raving and taking yer money
And you think it's funny
No you can't find it in no night club or no yacht club
And it ain't in the seats of a supper club
And sure as hell you're bound to tell
That no matter how hard you rub
You just ain't a-gonna find it on yer ticket stub
No, and it ain't in the rumors people're tellin' you
And it ain't in the pimple-lotion people are sellin' you
And it ain't in no cardboard-box house
Or down any movie star's blouse
And you can't find it on the golf course
And Uncle Remus can't tell you and neither can Santa Claus
And it ain't in the cream puff hair-do or cotton candy clothes
And it ain't in the dime store dummies or bubblegum goons
And it ain't in the marshmallow noises of the chocolate cake voices
That come knockin' and tappin' in Christmas wrappin'
Sayin' ain't I pretty and ain't I cute and look at my skin
Look at my skin shine, look at my skin glow
Look at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry
When you can't even sense if they got any insides
These people so pretty in their ribbons and bows
No you'll not now or no other day
Find it on the doorsteps made out-a paper mache
And inside it the people made of molasses
That every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses
And it ain't in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies
Who'd turn yuh in for a tenth of a penny
Who breathe and burp and bend and crack
And before you can count from one to ten
Do it all over again but this time behind yer back
My friend
The ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl
And play games with each other in their sand-box world
And you can't find it either in the no-talent fools
That run around gallant
And make all rules for the ones that got talent
And it ain't in the ones that ain't got any talent but think they do
And think they're foolin' you
The ones who jump on the wagon
Just for a while cause they know it's in style
To get their kicks, get out of it quick
And make all kinds of money and chicks
And you yell to yourself and you throw down yer hat
Sayin', ""Christ do I gotta be like that
Ain't there no one here that knows where I'm at
Ain't there no one here that knows how I feel
Good God Almighty
THAT STUFF AIN'T REAL""
No but that ain't yer game, it ain't yer race
You can't hear yer name, you can't see yer face
You gotta look some other place
And where do you look for this hope that yer seekin'
Where do you look for this lamp that's a-burnin'
Where do you look for this oil well gushin'
Where do you look for this candle that's glowin'
Where do you look for this hope that you know is there
And out there somewhere
And your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads
Your eyes can only look through two kinds of windows
Your nose can only smell two kinds of hallways
You can touch and twist
And turn two kinds of doorknobs
You can either go to the church of your choice
Or you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital
You'll find God in the church of your choice
You'll find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital

And though it's only my opinion
I may be right or wrong
You'll find them both
In the Grand Canyon

I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine,"I dreamed I saw St. Augustine
Alive as you or me
Tearing through these quarters
In the utmost misery
With a blanket underneath his arm
And a coat of solid gold
Searching for the very souls
Whom already have been sold

“Arise, arise,” he cried so loud
With a voice without restraint
“Come out, ye gifted kings and queens
And hear my sad complaint
No martyr is among ye now
Whom you can call your own
But go on your way accordingly
But know you’re not alone”

I dreamed I saw St. Augustine
Alive with fiery breath
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones
That put him out to death
Oh, I awoke in anger
So alone and terrified
I put my fingers against the glass
And bowed my head and cried1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
I Shall Be Free No. 10,"I’m just average, common too
I’m just like him, and the same as you
I’m everybody’s brother and son
I ain't different than anyone
Ain't no use a-talk to me
It’s just the same as talkin' to you

I was shadow boxing early in the day
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay
I said “Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come
26, 27, 28, 29, I’m gonna' make your face look just like mine
Five, four, three, two, one, Cassius Clay you’d better run

14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen”

Well, I don’t know, but I’ve been told
The streets of heaven are lined with gold
I ask ya' how things could get much worse
If the Russians happen to get up there first
Wowee! Pretty scary!

Now, I’m liberal, but to a degree
I want everybody to be free
But if you think I’ll let Barry Goldwater
Move in next door and marry my daughter
You must think I’m crazy!
I wouldn’t let him do it for all the farms in Cuba
Well, I set my monkey on the log
And ordered him to do the Dog
He wagged his tail and shook his head
And he went and did the Cat instead
He’s a weird monkey, very funky

I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on
Waitin' to play tennis in the noonday sun
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
And my wig-hat was fallin' in my face
But they wouldn’t let me on the tennis court

I got a woman, she’s so mean
She sticks my boots in the washing machine
Sticks me with buckshot when I’m nude
Puts bubblegum in my food
She’s funny, wants my money, calls me “honey”

Now I got a friend who spends his life
Stabbin' my picture with a Bowie knife
Dreams of stranglin' me with a scarf
When my name comes up he pretends to barf
I got a million friends!
Now they asked me to read a poem
At the sorority sisters home
Ah got knocked down and my head was swimmin'
I wound up with the Dean of Women
Yippee! I’m a poet, and I know it
Hope I don’t blow it

I’m gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
So I look like a walking mountain range
And I’m gonna' ride into Omaha on a horse
Out to the country club and the golf course
Carryin' The New York Times, shoot a few holes, blow their minds

Now you’re probably wonderin' by now
Just what this song is all about
What’s probably got you baffled more
Is what this thing here is for:
(plays song's riff)
It’s nothin'
It’s sumpin' I learned over in England!1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Moonshiner,"I've been a moonshiner
For seventeen long years
I've spent all my money
On whiskey and beer
I go to some hollow
And sit at my still
And if whiskey dont kill me
Then I dont know what will

I go to some bar room
And drink with my friends
Where the women can't follow
And see what I spend
God bless them pretty women
I wish they was mine
Their breath is as sweet
The dew on the vine

Let me eat when I am hungry
Let me drink when I am dry
A dollar when I am hard up
Religion when I die
The whole world's a bottle
And life's but a dram
When the bottle gets empty
It sure ain't worth a damn4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
John Wesley Harding,"John Wesley Harding
Was a friend to the poor
He traveled a'with a gun in ev'ry hand
All along this countryside
He opened a'many a door
But he was never known
To hurt an honest man

’Twas down in Chaynee County
A time they talk about
With his lady by his side
He took a stand
And soon the situation there
Was all but straightened out
For he was always known
To lend a helping hand

All across the telegraph
His name it did resound
But no charge held against him
Could they prove
And there was no man around
Who could track or chain him down
He was never known
To make a foolish move1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Tryin’ to Get to Heaven,"The air is getting hotter
There’s a rumbling in the skies
I’ve been wading through the high muddy water
With the heat rising in my eyes
Every day your memory grows dimmer
It doesn’t haunt me like it did before
I’ve been walking through the middle of nowhere
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door

When I was in Missouri
They would not let me be
I had to leave there in a hurry
I only saw what they let me see
You broke a heart that loved you
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore
I’ve been walking that lonesome valley
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door

People on the platforms
Waiting for the trains
I can hear their hearts a-beatin’
Like pendulums swinging on chains
When you think that you've lost everything
You find out you can always lose a little more
I’m just going down the road feeling bad
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door
I’m going down the river
Down to New Orleans
They tell me everything is gonna be all right
But I don’t know what “all right” even means
I was riding in a buggy with Miss Mary-Jane
Miss Mary-Jane got a house in Baltimore
I been all around the world, boys
Now I’m trying to get to heaven before they close the door

Gonna sleep down in the parlor
And relive my dreams
I’ll close my eyes and I wonder
If everything is as hollow as it seems
Some trains don't pull no gamblers
No midnight ramblers like they did before
I been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down
Now I’m trying to get to heaven before they close the door1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Highlands,"Well my heart’s in the Highlands gentle and fair
Honeysuckle blooming in the Wildwood air
Bluebells blazing where the Aberdeen waters flow
Well my heart’s in the Highland
I’m gonna go there when I feel good enough to go

Windows were shaking’ all night in my dreams
Everything was exactly the way that it seems
Woke up this morning and I looked at the same old page
Same ol’ rat race
Life in the same ol’ cage

I don’t want nothing from anyone, ain’t that much to take
Wouldn’t know the difference between a real blonde and a fake
Feel like a prisoner in a world of mystery
I wish someone would come
And push back the clock for me

Well my heart’s in the Highlands wherever I roam
That’s where I’ll be when I get called home
The wind, it whispers to the buckeyed trees in rhyme
Well my heart’s in the Highland
I can only get there one step at a time
I’m listening to Neil Young, I gotta turn up the sound
Someone’s always yelling turn it down
Feel like I’m drifting
Drifting from scene to scene
I’m wondering what in the devil could it all possibly mean?

Insanity is smashing up against my soul
You can say I was on anything but a roll
If I had a conscience, well, I just might blow my top
What would I do with it anyway
Maybe take it to the pawn shop

My heart’s in the Highlands at the break of dawn
By the beautiful lake of the Black Swan
Big white clouds like chariots that swing down low
Well my heart’s in the Highlands
Only place left to go

I’m in Boston town, in some restaurant
I got no idea what I want
Well, maybe I do but I’m just really not sure
Waitress comes over
Nobody in the place but me and her
Well, it must be a holiday, there’s nobody around
She studies me closely as I sit down
She got a pretty face and long white shiny legs
I say ""Tell me what I want""
She says, “You probably want hard boiled eggs.”

I say ""That's right: bring me some""
She says ""We ain't got any, you picked the wrong time to come”
Then she says, “I know you’re an artist, draw a picture of me!”
I say, “I would if I could, but
I don’t do sketches from memory”

“Well,” she says, “I’m right here in front of you, or haven’t you looked?”
I say, “All right, I know, but I don’t have my drawing book!”
She gives me a napkin, she says, “You can do it on that”
I say, “Yes I could, but
I don’t know where my pencil is at!”

She pulls one out from behind her ear
She says, “All right now, go ahead, draw me, I’m standing right here”
I make a few lines and I show it for her to see
Well she takes the napkin and throws it back
And says, “That don’t look a thing like me!”
I said, “Oh, kind Miss, it most certainly does”
She says, “You must be joking’.” I say, “I wish I was!”
Then she says, “You don’t read women authors, do you?”
Least that’s what I think I hear her say
“Well,” I say, “how would you know and what would it matter anyway?”

“Well,” she says, “you just don’t seem like you do!”
I said, “You’re way wrong”
She says, “Which ones have you read then?” I say, “I read Erica Jong!”
She goes away for a minute
And I slide up out of my chair
I step outside back to the busy street but nobody’s going anywhere

Well my heart’s in the Highlands with the horses and hounds
Way up in the border country, far from the towns
With the twang of the arrow and a snap of the bow
My heart’s in the Highlands
Can’t see any other way to go

Every day is the same thing out the door
Feel further away than ever before
Some things in life, it gets too late to learn
Well, I’m lost somewhere
I must have made a few bad turns

I see people in the park forgetting their troubles and woes
They’re drinking and dancing, wearing bright-colored clothes
All the young men with their young women looking so good
Well, I’d trade places with any of them
In a minute, if I could

I’m crossing the street to get away from a mangy dog
Talking to myself in a monologue
I think what I need might be a full-length leather coat
Somebody just asked me
If I registered to vote

The sun is beginning to shine on me
But it’s not like the sun that used to be
The party’s over and there’s less and less to say
I got new eyes
Everything looks far away

Well, my heart’s in the Highlands at the break of day
Over the hills and far away
There’s a way to get there and I’ll figure it out somehow
But I’m already there in my mind
And that’s good enough for now3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
"Farewell, Angelina","Farewell Angelina
The bells of the crown
Are being stolen by bandits
I must follow the sound
The triangle tingles
The music play slow
But farewell Angelina
The night is on fire
And I must go

There is no use in talking
And there's no need for blame
There is nothing to prove
Ev’rything still is the same
A table stands empty
By the edge of the stream
But farewell Angelina
The sky's changing colours
And I must leave

The jacks and the queens
They forsake the courtyard
Fifty-two gypsies
Now file past the guards
In the space where the deuce
And the ace once ran wild
Farewell Angelina
The sky is folding
I'll see you after a while
See the cross-eyed pirates sitting
Perched in the sun
Shooting tin cans
With a sawed-off shotgun
And the corporals and neighbors
Clap and cheer with each blast
Farewell Angelina
The sky it is trembling
And I must leave fast

King Kong, little elves
In the rooftoops they dance
Valentino-type tangos
While the hero's clean hands
Shut the eyes of the dead
Not to embarrass anyone
Farewell Angelina
The sky is flooding over
And I must be gone

The camouflaged parrot
He flutters from fear
When something he doesn't know about
Suddenly appears
What cannot be imitated
Perfect must die
Farewell Angelina
The sky's flooding over
And I must go where it is dry

Machine guns are roaring
Puppets heave rocks
At misunderstood visions
And at the faces of clocks
Call me any name you like
I will never deny it
But farewell Angelina
The sky is erupting
And I must go where it's quietEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Ballad in Plain D,"I once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn
I courted her proudly but now she is gone
Gone as the season she's taken

In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us

Of the two sisters, I loved the young
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one
Their constant scrapegoat, she was easily undone
By the jealousy of others around her

For her parasite sister, I had no respect
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
As a crutch for her scenes and her society

Myself, for what I did, I cannot be excused
The changes I was going through can't even be used
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
The could-be dream-lover of my lifetime
With unseen consciousness, I possessed in my grip
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
To the sin of love's false security

From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace
Answers of emptiness voice vacancies
'Til the tombstones of damage read no questions but please
What's wrong, what's exactly the matter?

And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen
The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream
At the peak of the night, the king and the queen
Tumbled all down into pieces

""The tragic figure"" her sister did shout
""Leave her alone, God damn you, get out""
And I in my armor, turning about
And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness

Beneath a bare light bulb the plaster did pound
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground
And she in between, the victim of sound
Soon shattered as a child to the shadows
All is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight
I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight
My mind it was mangled, I ran into the night
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me

The wind knocks my window, the room it is wet
The words to say I'm sorry, I haven't found yet
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
Will be fully aware of how precious she is

Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me
""How good, how good does it feel to be free?""
And I answer them most mysteriously
""Are birds free from the chains of the skyway?""EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
If Not for You,"If not for you
Babe, I couldn’t find the door
Couldn’t even see the floor
I’d be sad and blue
If not for you

If not for you
Babe, I’d lay awake all night
Wait for the morning light
To shine in through
But it would not be new
If not for you

If not for you, my sky would fall
Rain would gather too
Without your love, I’d be nowhere at all
I’d be lost if not for you
And you know it’s true

If not for you, my sky would fall
Rain would gather too
Without your love, I’d be nowhere at all
Oh, what would I do
If not for you
If not for you
Winter would have no spring
Couldn’t hear the robin sing

Anyway it wouldn’t ring true

I Threw It All Away,"I once held her
In my arms
She said she would
Always stay
But I was cruel
I treated her like a fool
I threw it all away

Once I had mountains
In the palm of my hand
And rivers that ran through
Every day
But I must have been mad
I never knew what I had
Until I threw it all away

Love is all there is
It makes the world go ’round
Love and only love
It can’t be denied
No matter what you think about it
You just won’t be able to do without it
Take a tip from one who’s tried
So if you find someone
Who gives you all of her love
Take it to your heart, don’t let it stray
For one thing for certain
You will surely be a-hurtin'
If you throw it all away
If you throw it all away3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Restless Farewell,"Oh all the money that in my whole life I did spend
Be it mine right or wrongfully
I let it slip gladly to my friends
To tie up the time most forcefully
But the bottles are done
We’ve killed each one
And the table’s full and overflowed
And the corner sign
Says it’s closin' time
So I’ll bid farewell and be down the road
Oh every girl that ever I’ve touched
I did not do it harmfully
And every girl that ever I’ve hurt
I did not do it knowingly
But to remain as friends
You need the time to make amends
And stay behind
And since my feet are now fast
And point away from the past
I’ll bid farewell and be down the line
Oh every foe that ever I faced
The cause was there before we came
And every cause that ever I fought
I fought it full without regret or shame
But the dark does die
As the curtain is drawn and somebody’s eyes
Must meet the dawn
And if I see the day
I’d only have to stay
So I’ll bid farewell in the night and be gone
Oh, every thought that’s strung a knot in my mind
I might go insane if it couldn’t be sprung
But it’s not to stand naked under unknowin' eyes
It’s for myself and my friends my stories are sung
But the time ain’t tall, if on time you depend
And no word is possessed by no special friend
And though the line is cut
It ain’t quite the end
I’ll just bid farewell 'til we meet again
Oh a false clock tries to tick out my time
To disgrace, distract, and bother me
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
And the dust of rumors covers me
But if the arrow is straight
And the point is slick
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
So I’ll make my stand
And remain as I am
And bid farewell and not give a damn2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
As I Went Out One Morning,"As I went out one morning
To breathe the air around Tom Paine’s
I spied the fairest damsel
That ever did walk in chains
I offered her my hand
She took me by the arm
I knew that very instant
She meant to do me harm

“Depart from me this moment”
I told her with my voice
Said she, “But I don’t wish to”
Said I, “But you have no choice”
“I beg you, sir,” she pleaded
From the corners of her mouth
“I will secretly accept you
And together we’ll fly south”

Just then Tom Paine, himself
Came running from across the field
Shouting at this lovely girl
And commanding her to yield
And as she was letting go her grip
Up Tom Paine did run
“I’m sorry, sir,” he said to me
“I’m sorry for what she’s done”1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Señor (Tales of Yankee Power),"Señor, señor
Can you tell me where we're headin'
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon
Seems like I been down this way before
Is there any truth in that, señor

Señor, señor
Do you know where she's hidin'
How long are we gonna be riding
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door
Will there be any comfort there, señor

There's a wicked wind still blowing on that upper deck
And there's an iron cross still hanging from around her neck
There's a marching band still playing in that vacant lot
Where's she held me in her arms one time and said
""Forget me not""

Señor, señor
I can see that painted wagon
Smell the tail of the dragon
I can't stand the suspense here anymore
Can you tell me who to contact here, señor

Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field
And a gypsy with a broken flag and flashing ring
Said ""Son, this ain't a dream no more, it's the real thing""

Señor, señor
You know their hearts are hard as leather
Give me a minute, let me get it together
I just gotta pick myself up off the floor
I'm ready when you are, señor

Señor, señor
Let's overturn these tables
And disconnect these cables
This place don't make sense to me no more
Can you tell me what we're waiting for, señor1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Melancholy Mood,"Melancholy mood forever haunts me
Steals upon me in the night, forever taunts me
Oh, what a lonely soul am I, stranded high and dry
By a melancholy mood

Gone is every joy and inspiration
Tears are all I have to show, no consolation
All I see is grief and gloom, 'til the crack of doom
Oh, melancholy mood

Deep in the night I search for a trace
Of a lingering kiss, a warm embrace
But love is a whimsy, as flimsy as lace
And my arms embrace an empty space

Melancholy mood, why must you blind me
Pity me and break the chains, the chains that bind me
Won't you release me, set me free, bring her back to me
Oh, melancholy moodEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Slow Train,"Sometimes
I feel so low-down and disgusted
Can't help but wonder what's happening to my companions
Are they lost or are they found?
Have they counted the cost it'll take to bring down
All their earthly principles they're going to have to abandon?
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend

I had a woman
Down in Alabama
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic
She said, ""Boy, without a doubt
Have to quit your mess and straighten out
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic""
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend

All that foreign oil
Controlling American soil
Look around you, it's just bound to make you embarrassed
Sheiks walking around like kings
Wearing fancy jewels and nose rings
Deciding America's future from Amsterdam and Paris
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend
Man's ego is inflated
His laws are outdated,
They don't apply no more, you can't rely no more to be standing around waiting
In the home of the brave
Jefferson turning over in his grave
Fools glorifying themselves, trying to manipulate Satan
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend

Big-time negotiators
False healers and woman-haters
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition
But the enemy I see
Wears a cloak of decency
All non-believers and men-stealers talking in the name of religion
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend

People starving and thirsting
Grain elevators are bursting
Oh, you know it costs more to store the food than it do to give it
They say, ""Lose your inhibitions
Follow your own ambitions""
They talk about a life of brotherly love; show me someone who knows how to live it
There's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend
Well, my baby went to Illinois
With some bad-talking boy she could destroy
A real suicide case, but there was nothing I could do to stop it
I don't care about economy
I don't care about astronomy
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets
And there's a slow, slow train coming up around the bend1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Black Diamond Bay,"Up on the white veranda
She wears a necktie and a Panama hat
Her passport shows a face
From another time and place
She looks nothing like that
And all the remnants of her recent past
Are scattered in the wild wind
She walks across the marble floor
Where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in
She smiles, walks the other way
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away
From Black Diamond Bay

As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down
And he asks for a rope and a pen that will write
“Pardon, monsieur,” the desk clerk says
Carefully removes his fez
“Am I hearing you right?”
And as the yellow fog is lifting
The Greek is quickly heading for the second floor
She passes him on the spiral staircase
Thinking he’s the Soviet Ambassador
She starts to speak, but he walks away
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway
On Black Diamond Bay
A soldier sits beneath the fan
Doing business with a tiny man who sells him a ring
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out
The desk clerk wakes and begins to shout
“Can you see anything?”
Then the Greek appears on the second floor
In his bare feet with a rope around his neck
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle
Says, “Open up another deck”
But the dealer says, “Attendez-vous, s’il vous plait”
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away
From Black Diamond Bay

The desk clerk heard the woman laugh
As he looked around the aftermath and the soldier got tough
He tried to grab the woman’s hand
Said, “Here’s a ring, it cost a grand”
She said, “That ain't enough”
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags
While a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb
She passed the door that the Greek had locked
Where a handwritten sign read, “Do Not Disturb”
She knocked upon it anyway
As the sun went down and the music did play
On Black Diamond Bay
“I’ve got to talk to someone quick!”
But the Greek said, “Go away,” and he kicked the chair to the floor
He hung there from the chandelier
She cried, “Help, there’s danger near
Please open up the door!”
Then the volcano erupted
And the lava flowed down from the mountain high above
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner
Thinking of forbidden love
But the desk clerk said, “It happens every day”
As the stars fell down and the fields burned away
On Black Diamond Bay

As the island slowly sank
The loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room
The dealer said, “It’s too late now
You can take your money, but I don’t know how
You’ll spend it in the tomb”
The tiny man bit the soldier’s ear
As the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew
While she’s out on the balcony, where a stranger tells her
“My darling, je vous aime beaucoup”
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
As the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away
From Black Diamond Bay
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A
Watching old Cronkite on the seven o’clock news
It seems there was an earthquake that
Left nothing but a Panama hat
And a pair of old Greek shoes
Didn’t seem like much was happening
So I turned it off and went to grab another beer
Seems like every time you turn around
There’s another hard-luck story that you’re going to hear
And there’s really nothing anyone can say

Neighborhood Bully,"Well, the neighborhood bully, he’s just one man
His enemies say he’s on their land
They got him outnumbered about a million to one
He got no place to escape to, no place to run
He’s the neighborhood bully

The neighborhood bully just lives to survive
He’s criticized and condemned for being alive
He’s not supposed to fight back, he’s supposed to have thick skin
He’s supposed to lay down and die when his door is kicked in
He’s the neighborhood bully

The neighborhood bully been driven out of every land
He’s wandered the earth an exiled man
Seen his family scattered, his people hounded and torn
He’s always on trial for just being born
He’s the neighborhood bully

Well, he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized
Old women condemned him, said he should apologize
Then he destroyed a bomb factory, nobody was glad
The bombs were meant for him. He was supposed to feel bad
He’s the neighborhood bully
Well, the chances are against it and the odds are slim
That he’ll live by the rules that the world makes for him
Because there’s a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
And a license to kill him is given out to every maniac
He’s the neighborhood bully

He got no allies to really speak of
What he gets he must pay for, he don’t get it out of love
He buys obsolete weapons and he won’t be denied
But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side
He’s the neighborhood bully

Well, he’s surrounded by pacifists who all want peace
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed must cease
Now, they wouldn’t hurt a fly. To hurt one they would weep
They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep
He’s the neighborhood bully

Every empire that’s enslaved him is gone
Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon
He’s made a garden of paradise in the desert sand
In bed with nobody, under no one’s command
He’s the neighborhood bully
Now his holiest books have been trampled upon
No contract he signed was worth what it was written on
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth
Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health
He’s the neighborhood bully

What’s anybody indebted to him for?
Nothing, they say. He just likes to cause war
Pride and prejudice and superstition indeed
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed
He’s the neighborhood bully

What has he done to wear so many scars?
Does he change the course of rivers? Does he pollute the moon and stars?
Neighborhood bully, standing on the hill
Running out the clock, time standing still

Talkin’ New York,"Rambling out of the wild West
Leaving the towns I love the best
Thought I’d seen some ups and downs
'Til I come into New York town
People going down to the ground
Buildings going up to the sky

Wintertime in New York town
The wind blowing snow around
Walk around with nowhere to go
Somebody could freeze right to the bone
I froze right to the bone
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years
I didn’t feel so cold then

I swung on to my old guitar
Grabbed hold of a subway car
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
I landed up on the downtown side
Greenwich Village

I walked down there and ended up
In one of them coffeehouses on the block
Got on the stage to sing and play
Man there said, “Come back some other day
You sound like a hillbilly
We want folk singers here”
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day
I blowed inside out and upside down
The man there said he loved my sound
He was raving about how he loved my sound
Dollar a day’s worth

And after weeks and weeks of hanging around
I finally got a job in New York town
In a bigger place, bigger money too
Even joined the union and paid my dues

Now, a very great man once said
That some people rob you with a fountain pen
It didn’t take too long to find out
Just what he was talkin’ about
A lot of people don’t have much food on their table
But they got a lot of forks ’n’ knives
And they got to cut something

So one morning when the sun was warm
I rambled out of New York town
Pulled my cap down over my eyes
And headed out for the western skies
So long, New York

Sweetheart Like You,"Well, the pressure’s down, the boss ain't here
He gone North, for a while
They say that vanity got the best of him
But he sure left here in style
By the way, that’s a cute hat
And that smile’s so hard to resist
But what’s a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?

You know, I once knew a woman who looked like you
She wanted a whole man, not just a half
She used to call me sweet daddy when I was only a child
You kind of remind me of her when you laugh
In order to deal in this game, got to make the queen disappear
It’s done with a flick of the wrist
What’s a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?

You know, a woman like you should be at home
That’s where you belong
Watching out for someone who loves you true
Who would never do you wrong
Just how much abuse will you be able to take?
Well, there’s no way to tell by that first kiss
What’s a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?
You know you can make a name for yourself
You can hear them tires squeal
You can be known as the most beautiful woman
Who ever crawled across cut glass to make a deal

You know, news of you has come down the line
Even before you came in the door
They say in your father’s house, there’s many mansions
Each one of them got a fireproof floor
Snap out of it, baby, people are jealous of you
They smile to your face, but behind your back they hiss
What’s a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?

Got to be an important person to be in here, honey
Got to have done some evil deed
Got to have your own harem when you come in the door
Got to play your harp until your lips bleed

They say that patriotism is the last refuge
To which a scoundrel clings
Steal a little and they throw you in jail
Steal a lot and they make you king
There’s only one step down from here, baby
It’s called the land of permanent bliss
What’s a sweetheart like you doing in a dump like this?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Brownsville Girl,"Well, there was this movie I seen one time
About a man riding ’cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck

Well, the marshal, now he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
As the dying gunfighter lay in the sun and gasped for his last breath
“Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square
I want him to feel what it’s like to every moment face his death”

Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
And you know it blows right through me like a ball and chain
You know I can’t believe we’ve lived so long and are still so far apart
The memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train

I can still see the day that you came to me on the painted desert
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet
Ah, but you were right. It was perfect as I got in behind the wheel

Well, we drove that car all night into San Anton’
And we slept near the Alamo, your skin was so tender and soft
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back
I would have gone on after you but I didn’t feel like letting my head get blown off
Well, we’re driving’ this car and the sun is coming’ up over the Rockies
Now I know she ain’t you but she’s here and she’s got that dark rhythm in her soul
But I’m too over the edge and I ain’t in the mood anymore to remember the times
When I was your only man
And she don’t want to remind me. She knows this car would go out of control

Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world
Brownsville girl, you’re my honey love

Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live. He owned a Wreckin’ lot outside of town about a mile
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back. She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust
She said, “Henry ain’t here but you can come on in, he’ll be back in a little while”

Then she told us how times were tough and about how she was thinking’ of
Bumming a ride back from where she started
But ya know, she changed the subject every time money came up
She said, “Welcome to the land of the living dead”
You could tell she was so broken hearted
She said, “Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt”
“How far are y’all going?” Ruby asked us with a sigh
“We’re going all the way ’till the wheels fall off and burn
’Til the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies”
Ruby just smiled and said, “Ah, you know some babies never learn”

Something about that movie though, well I just can’t get it out of my head
But I can’t remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play
All I remember about it was Gregory Peck and the way people moved
And a lot of them seemed to be looking’ my way


Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour
I was crossing’ the street when shots rang out
I didn’t know whether to duck or to run, so I ran
“We got him cornered in the churchyard,” I heard somebody shout

Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune. Underneath it
It said, “A man with no alibi”
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you
Then when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears
It was the best acting I saw anybody do
Now I’ve always been the kind of person that doesn’t like to trespass
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line
Oh if there’s an original thought out there, I could use it right now
You know, I feel pretty good, but that is not saying’ much. I could feel a whole lot better
If you were just here by my side to show me how

Well, I’m standing’ in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck
Yeah, but you know it’s not the one that I had in mind
He’s got a new one out now, I don’t even know what it’s about
But I’ll see him in anything so I’ll stand in line


You know, it’s funny how things never turn out the way you had ’em planned
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter is that his name wasn’t Henry Porter
And you know there was something’ about you baby that I liked that was always too good for this world
Just like you always said there was something’ about me you liked
That I left behind in the French Quarter

Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections than people who are most content
I don’t have any regrets, they can talk about me plenty when I’m gone
You always said people don’t do what they believe in, they just do what’s most convenient, then they repent
And I always said, “Hang on to me, baby, and let’s hope that the roof stays on”

There was a movie I seen one time, I think I sat through it twice
I don’t remember who I was or where I was bound
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck, he wore a gun
And he was shot in the back
Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down

House of the Risin’ Sun,"There is a house down in New Orleans they call the rising sun
And it's been the ruin of many poor girl and me, oh God, I'm one

My mother was a tailor, she sewed these new blue jeans
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord, down in New Orleans

Now the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time when he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk

He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
And the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town

Oh tell my baby sister not to do what I have done
But shun that house in New Orleans they call the rising sun

Well with one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train
I'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain

I'm going back to New Orleans, my race is almost run
I'm going back to end my life down in the rising sun

I’ll Be Your Baby Tonight,"Close your eyes, close the door
Ya' don’t have to worry anymore
I’ll be your baby tonight

Shut the light, shut the shade
Ya' don’t have to be afraid
I’ll be your baby tonight

Well, that mockingbird’s gonna sail away
We’re gonna forget it

But we’re gonna let it
You won’t regret it

Kick your shoes off, do not fear

Mozambique,"I like to spend some time in Mozambique
The sunny sky is aqua blue
And all the couples dancing cheek to cheek
It’s very nice to stay a week or two
And maybe fall in love, just me and you


There’s lot of pretty girls in Mozambique
And plenty time for good romance
And everybody likes to stop and speak
To give the special one you seek a chance
Or maybe say hello with just a glance


Lying next to her by the ocean
Reaching out and touching her hand
Whispering your secret emotion
Magic in a magical land

And when it’s time for leaving Mozambique
To say goodbye to sand and sea
You turn around to take a final peek
And you see why it’s so unique to be
Among the lovely people living free
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique

License to Kill,"Man thinks because he rules the earth he can do with it as he please
And if things don’t change soon, he will
Oh, man has invented his doom
First step was touching the moon

Now, there’s a woman on my block
She just sit there as the night grows still
She say who going to take away his license to kill?

Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
And they set him on a path where he’s bound to get ill
Then they bury him with stars
Sell his body like they do used cars

Now, there’s a woman on my block
She just sits there facing the hill
She say who going to take away his license to kill?

Now, he’s hell-bent for destruction, he’s afraid and confused
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill
All he believes are his eyes
And his eyes, they just tell him lies
But there’s a woman on my block
Sitting there in a cold chill
She say who going to take away his license to kill?

You may be a noisemaker, spirit maker
Heartbreaker, backbreaker
Leave no stone unturned
May be an actor in a plot
That might be all that you got
Till your error you clearly learn

Now he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
And when he sees his reflection, he’s fulfilled
Oh, man is opposed to fair play
He wants it all and he wants it his way

Now, there’s a woman on my block
She just sit there as the night grows still
She say who going to take away his license to kill?1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Abandoned Love,"I can see the turning of the key
I’ve been deceived by the clown inside of me
I thought that he was righteous but he’s vain
Oh, something’s a-telling me I wear the ball and chain

My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost
He’s always off somewhere when I need him most
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill
But my heart is a-tellin’ me I love ya still

I come back to the town from the flaming moon
I see you in the streets, I begin to swoon
I love to see you dress before the mirror
Won’t you let me in your room one time ’fore I finally disappear?

Everybody’s wearing a disguise
To hide what they’ve got left behind their eyes
But me, I can’t cover what I am
Wherever the children go I’ll follow them

I march in the parade of liberty
But as long as I love you I’m not free
How long must I suffer such abuse
Won’t you let me see you smile one time before I turn you loose?
I’ve given up the game, I’ve got to leave
The pot of gold is only make-believe
The treasure can’t be found by men who search
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church

We sat in an empty theater and we kissed
I asked ya please to cross me off-a your list
My head tells me it’s time to make a change
But my heart is telling me I love ya but you’re strange

One more time at midnight, near the wall
Take off your heavy makeup and your shawl
Won’t you descend from the throne, from where you sit?
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
I Pity the Poor Immigrant,"I pity the poor immigrant
Who wishes he would’ve stayed home
Who uses all his power to do evil
But in the end is always left so alone
That man whom with his fingers cheats
And who lies with every breath
Who passionately hates his life
And likewise, fears his death

I pity the poor immigrant
Whose strength is spent in vain
Whose heaven is like Ironsides
Whose tears are like rain
Who eats but is not satisfied
Who hears but does not see
Who falls in love with wealth itself
And turns his back on me

I pity the poor immigrant
Who tramples through the mud
Who fills his mouth with laughing
And who builds his town with blood
Whose visions in the final end
Must shatter like the glass
I pity the poor immigrant
When his gladness comes to passEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Dark Eyes,"Oh, the gentlemen are talking and the midnight moon is on the riverside
They’re drinking up and walking and it is time for me to slide
I live in another world where life and death are memorized
Where the earth is strung with lovers' pearls and all I see are dark eyes

A cock is crowing far away and another soldier’s deep in prayer
Some mother’s child has gone astray, she can’t find him anywhere
But I can hear another drum beating for the dead that rise
Whom nature’s beast fears as they come and all I see are dark eyes

They tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes
They tell me revenge is sweet and from where they stand, I’m sure it is
But I feel nothing for their game where beauty goes unrecognized
All I feel is heat and flame and all I see are dark eyes

Oh, the French girl, she’s in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel
Hunger pays a heavy price to the falling gods of speed and steel
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet and passion rules the arrow that flies
A million faces at my feet but all I see are dark eyes2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Broken buckles, broken laws
Broken bodies, broken bones
Broken voices on broken phones
Take a deep breath, feel like you’re choking

Broken treaties, broken vows
Broken pipes, broken tools
People bending broken rules

John Brown,"John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore
His mama sure was proud of him!
He stood straight and tall in his uniform and all
His mama’s face broke out all in a grin

“Oh son, you look so fine, I’m glad you’re a son of mine
You make me proud to know you hold a gun
Do what the captain says, lots of medals you will get
And we’ll put them on the wall when you come home”

As that old train pulled out, John’s ma began to shout
Telling’ everyone in the neighborhood:
“That’s my son that’s about to go, he’s a soldier now, you know”
She made well sure her neighbors understood

She got a letter once in a while and her face broke into a smile
As she showed them to the people from next door
And she bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
And these things you called a good old-fashioned war
Oh! Good old-fashioned war!
Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come
They ceased to come for about ten months or more
Then a letter finally came saying, “Go down and meet the train
Your son’s a-coming home from the war”

She smiled and went right down, she looked everywhere around
But she could not see her soldier son in sight
But as all the people passed, she saw her son at last
When she did she could hardly believe her eyes

Oh his face was all shot up and his hand was all blown off
And he wore a metal brace around his waist
He whispered kind of slow, in a voice she did not know
While she couldn’t even recognize his face!
Oh! Lord! Not even recognize his face

“Oh tell me, my darling son, pray tell me what they done
How is it you come to be this way?”
He tried his best to talk but his mouth could hardly move
And the mother had to turn her face away
“Don’t you remember, Ma, when I went off to war
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
I was on the battleground, you were home. Acting proud
You wasn’t there standing in my shoes”

“Oh, and I thought when I was there, God, what am I doing here?
I’m a-tryin’ to kill somebody or die tryin’
But the thing that scared me most was when my enemy came close
And I saw that his face looked just like mine”
Oh! Lord! Just like mine!

“And I couldn’t help but think, through the thunder rolling and stink
That I was just a puppet in a play
And through the roar and smoke, this string is finally broke
And a cannon ball blew my eyes away”

As he turned away to walk, his Ma was still in shock
At seeing’ the metal brace that helped him stand
But as he turned to go, he called his mother close
And he dropped his medals down into her handEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Workingman’s Blues #2,"There's an evening' haze settlin' over the town
Starlight by the edge of the creek
The buyin' power of the proletariat's gone down
Money's gettin' shallow and weak
The place I love best is a sweet memory
It's a new path that we trod
They say low wages are a reality
If we want to compete abroad

My cruel weapons have been put on the shelf
Come sit down on my knee
You are dearer to me than myself
As you yourself can see
I'm listening' to the steel rails hum
Got both eyes tight shut
Just sitting here trying to keep the hunger from
Creeping it's way into my gut

Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
Bring me my boots and shoes
You can hang back or fight your best on the front line
Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues
Now, I'm sailing' on back, ready for the long haul
Tossed by the winds and the seas
I'll drag them all down to hell and I'll stand them at the wall
I'll sell them to their enemies
I'm trying' to feed my soul with thought
Gonna sleep off the rest of the day
Sometimes no one wants what we got
Sometimes you can't give it away

Now the place is ringed with countless foes
Some of them may be deaf and dumb
No man, no woman knows
The hour that sorrow will come
In the dark I hear the night birds call
I can hear a lover's breath
I sleep in the kitchen with my feet in the hall
Sleep is like a temporary death


Well, they burned my barn, they stole my horse
I can't save a dime
I got to be careful, I don't want to be forced
Into a life of continual crime
I can see for myself that the sun is sinking
How I wish you were here to see
Tell me now, am I wrong in thinking
That you have forgotten me?
Now they worry and they hurry and they fuss and they fret
They waste your nights and days
Them I will forget
But you I'll remember always
Old memories of you to me have clung
You've wounded me with words
Gonna have to straighten out your tongue
It's all true, everything you have heard


In you, my friend, I find no blame
Wanna look in my eyes, please do
No one can ever claim
That I took up arms against you
All across the peaceful sacred fields
They will lay you low
They'll break your horns and slash you with steel
I say it so it must be so

Now I'm down on my luck and I'm black and blue
Gonna give you another chance
I'm all alone and I'm expecting you
To lead me off in a cheerful dance
Got a brand new suit and a brand new wife
I can live on rice and beans
Some people never worked a day in their life
Don't know what work even means

Spanish Harlem Incident,"Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
Cannot hold you to its heat
Your temperature is too hot for taming
Your flaming feet are burning up the street
I'm homeless, come and take me
To the reach of your rattlin' drums
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
Down along my restless palms

Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed
I have fallen far beneath
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing
And your flashing diamond teeth
The night is pitch black, come an’ make my
Pale face fit into place, ah, please!
Let me know, babe, I’m nearly drowning
If it’s you my lifelines trace

I been wondering all about me
Ever since I seen you there
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I’m riding
I know I’m around you but I don’t know where
You have slayed me, you have made me
I got to laugh half ways off my heels
I got to know, babe, yeah will you surround me?
So I can know if I’m really real3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
I and I,"Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams
In another lifetime she must have owned the world, or been faithfully wed
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams

I and I
In creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives

Think I’ll go out and go for a walk
Not much happening here, nothing ever does
Besides, if she wakes up now, she’ll just want me to talk
I got nothing to say, specially about whatever was

I and I
In creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives

Took an untrodden path once, where the swift don’t win the race
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth
Took a stranger to teach me, to look into justice’s beautiful face
And to see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
I and I
In creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives

Outside of two men on a train platform there’s nobody in sight
They’re waiting for spring to come, smoking down the track
The world could come to an end tonight, but that’s all right
She should still be there sleepin’ when I get back

I and I
In creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives

Noontime, and I’m still pushing myself along the road, the darkest part
Into the narrow lanes, I can’t stumble or stay put
Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I’m listening only to my heart
I’ve made shoes for everyone, even you, while I still go barefoot

I and I
In creation where one’s nature neither honors nor forgives
I and I
One says to the other, no man sees my face and lives

Talkin’ John Birch Paranoid Blues,"Well, I was feeling sad and feeling blue
I didn’t know what in the world I wus gonna do
Them Communists they was coming around
They was in the air
They was on the ground
They wouldn’t give me no peace

So I run down most hurriedly
And joined up with the John Birch Society
I got me a secret membership card
And started off a-walking down the road
Yee-hoo, I’m a real John Bircher now!
Look out you Commies!

Now we all agree with Hitler’s views
Although he killed six million Jews
It don’t matter too much that he was a Fascist
At least you can’t say he was a Communist!
That’s to say like if you got a cold you take a shot of malaria

Well, I woos looking everywhere for them gol-darned Reds
I got up in the morning and looked under my bed
Looked in the sink, behind the door
Looked in the glove compartment of my car
Couldn’t find them
I woos looking high and low for them Reds everywhere
I woos looking in the sink and underneath the chair
I looked way up my chimney hole
I even looked deep down inside my toilet bowl
They got away

Well, I woos sitting home alone and started to sweat
Figured they woos in my T.V. set
Peeked behind the picture frame
Got a shock from my feet, hitting right up in the brain
Them Reds caused it!
I know they did them hard-core ones

Well, I quit my job so I could work all alone
Then I changed my name to Sherlock Holmes
Followed some clues from my detective bag
And discovered they woos red stripes on the American flag!
That old Betsy Ross

Well, I investigated all the books in the library
Ninety percent of them gotta be burned away
I investigated all the people that I know
Ninety-eight percent of them gotta go
The other two percent are fellow Birchers just like me
Now Eisenhower, he’s a Russian spy
Lincoln, Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy
To my knowledge there’s just one man
That’s really a true American: George Lincoln Rockwell
I know for a fact he hates Commies because he picketed the movie Exodus

Well, I finally started thinking straight
When I run out of things to investigate
Couldn’t imagine doing anything else
So now I’m sitting home investigating myself!
Hope I don’t find out anything hmm, great God!1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Political World,"We live in a political world
Love don’t have any place
We’re living in times where men commit crimes
And crime don’t have a face

We live in a political world
Icicles hanging down
Wedding bells ring and angels sing
Clouds cover up the ground

We live in a political world
Wisdom is thrown into jail
It rots in a cell, is misguided as hell
Leaving no one to pick up a trail

We live in a political world
Where mercy walks the plank
Life is in mirrors, death disappears
Up the steps into the nearest bank

We live in a political world
Where courage is a thing of the past
Houses are haunted, children are unwanted
The next day could be your last
We live in a political world
The one we can see and can feel
But there’s no one to check, it’s all a stacked deck
We all know for sure that it’s real

We live in a political world
In the cities of lonesome fear
Little by little you turn in the middle
But you’re never sure why you’re here

We live in a political world
Under the microscope
You can travel anywhere and hang yourself there
You always got more than enough rope

We live in a political world
Turning and a-thrashing about
As soon as you’re awake, you’re trained to take
What looks like the easy way out

We live in a political world
Where peace is not welcome at all
It’s turned away from the door to wander some more
Or put up against the wall
We live in a political world
Everything is hers or his
Climb into the frame and shout God’s name
But you’re never sure what it isEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
I Was Young When I Left Home,"I was young when I left home
But I been out a-rambling around
And I never wrote a letter to my home
To my home, Lord, to my home
And I never wrote a letter to my home

It was just the other day
I was bringing home my pay
When I met an old friend I used to know

Said your mother’s dead and gone
Baby sister’s all gone wrong
And your daddy needs you home right away

Not a shirt on my back
Not a penny on my name
Well I can’t go home Thisaway
Thisaway, Lord, Lord, Lord
And I can’t go home Thisaway

If you miss the train I’m on
Count the days I’m gone
You will hear that whistle blow a hundred miles
A hundred miles, honey baby. Lord Lord Lord
And you’ll hear that whistle blow a hundred miles
I’m playing on a track
Ma would come and whoop me back
On them trestles down by old Jim McKay’s

When I pay the debt I owe
To the commissary store
I will pawn my watch and chain and go home
Go home, Lord Lord Lord
I will pawn my watch and chain and go home

Used to tell Ma sometimes
When I see them riding blinds
Going to make me a home out in the wind
In the wind, Lord in the wind
Make me a home out in the wind

I don’t like it in the wind
Want to go back home again
But I can’t go home Thisaway
Thisaway, Lord Lord Lord
And I can’t go home Thisaway

I Could Have Told You,"I could have told you
She'd hurt you
She'd you love you a while
Then desert you
If only you asked
I could have told you so

I could have saved you
Some crying
Yes, I could have told you she's lying
But you were in love
And didn't want to know

I hear her now
As I toss and turn and try to sleep
I hear her now
Making promises she'll never keep
And soon, it's over and done with
She'll find someone new to have fun with
Through all of my tears
I could have told you so

Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn),"Everybody’s building the big ships and the boats
Some are building monuments
Others, jotting down notes
Ev’rybody’s in despair
Every girl and boy
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here
Ev’rybody’s gonna jump for joy
Come all without, come all within
You’ll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn

I like to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet
But guarding fumes and making haste
It ain’t my cup of meat
Everybody’s neath the trees
Feeding pigeons on a limb
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here
All the pigeons gonna run to him
Come all without, come all within
You’ll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn

A cat’s meow and a cow’s moo, I can recite them all
Just tell me where it hurts yuh, honey
And I’ll tell you who to call
Nobody can get no sleep
There’s someone on ev’ryone’s toes
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here
Ev’rybody’s gonna wanna doze
Come all without, come all within
You’ll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
To Be Alone with You,"Is it rolling, Bob?

To be alone with you
Just you and me
Now won’t you tell me true
Ain’t that the way it oughta be?
To hold each other tight
The whole night through
Everything is always right
When I’m alone with you

To be alone with you
At the close of the day
With only you in view
While evening slips away
It only goes to show
That while life’s pleasures be few
The only one I know
Is when I’m alone with you

They say that nighttime is the right time
To be with the one you love
Too many thoughts get in the way in the day
But you’re always what I’m thinkin' of
I wish the night were here
Bringin' me all of your charms
When only you are near
To hold me in your arms
I’ll always thank the Lord
When my workin' day is through
I get my sweet reward
To be alone with you1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Dignity,"Fat man looking in a blade of steel
Thin man looking at his last meal
Hollow man looking in a cotton field
For dignity

Wise man looking in a blade of grass
Young man looking in the shadows that pass
Poor man looking through painted glass
For dignity

Somebody got murdered on New Year’s Eve
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave
I went into the city, went into the town
Went into the land of the midnight sun

Searching high, searching low
Searching everywhere I know
Asking the cops wherever I go
Have you seen dignity?

Blind man breaking out of a trance
Puts both his hands in the pockets of chance
Hoping to find one circumstance
Of dignity
I went to the wedding of Mary Lou
She said, “I don’t want nobody see me talking to you”
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew
About dignity

I went down where the vultures feed
I would’ve gone deeper, but there wasn’t any need
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
Wasn’t any difference to me

Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade
House on fire, debts unpaid
Gonna stand at the window, going to ask the maid
Have you seen dignity?

Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors
Looking into the lost forgotten years
For dignity

Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues
Said he’d give me information if his name wasn’t used
He wanted money up front, said he was abused
By dignity
Footprints running across the silver sand
Steps going down into tattoo land
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
In the border towns of despair

Got no place to fade, got no coat
I’m on the rolling river in a jerkin boat
Trying to read a note somebody wrote
About dignity

Sick man looking for the doctor’s cure
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
And into every masterpiece of literature
For dignity

Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin
Bites the bullet and he looks within
For dignity

Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed
Dignity never been photographed
I went into the red, went into the black
Into the valley of dry bone dreams
So many roads, so much at stake
So many dead ends, I’m at the edge of the lake
Sometimes I wonder what it’s going to take
To find dignityEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Jesus going to make up, Jesus going to make up
Jesus going to make up my dying bed

Well, well, well, so I can die easy

Cold Irons Bound,"I’m beginning to hear voices and there’s no one around
Well, I’m all used up and the fields have turned brown
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by
My love for her is taking such a long time to die
I’m waist deep, waist deep in the mist
It’s almost like, almost like I don’t exist
I’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound

The walls of pride are high and wide
Can’t see over to the other side
It’s such a sad thing to see beauty decay
It’s sadder still to feel your heart torn away
One look at you and I’m out of control
Like the universe has swallowed me whole
I’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound

There’s too many people, too many to recall
I thought some of ’m were friends of mine, I was wrong about ’m all
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside’s mud
Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood
I found my world, found my world in you
But your love just hasn’t proved true
I’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
Twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound

Oh, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds
Reality has always had too many heads
Some things last longer than you think they will
There are some kind of things you can never kill
It’s you and you only I been thinking about
But you can’t see in and it’s hard lookin’ out
I’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound

Well the fat’s in the fire and the water’s in the tank
The whiskey’s in the jar and the money’s in the bank
I tried to love and protect you because I cared
I’m gonna remember forever the joy that we shared
Looking at you and I’m on my bended knee
You have no idea what you do to me
I’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
Twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
I Don’t Believe You (She Acts Like We Never Have Met),"I can't understand, she let go of my hand
And left me here facing the wall
I’d sure like to know why she'd go
But I can't get close to her at all
Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime
She said she would never forget
But now morning’s clear, it’s like I ain't here
She acts like we never met

It’s all new to me, like some mystery
It could even be like a myth
But it’s hard to think on that she’s the same one
That last night I was with
From darkness, dreams are deserted
Am I still dreaming yet?
I wish she’d unlock her voice once and talk
'Stead of actin' like we never have met

If she ain't feelin' well, then why don’t she tell
'Stead of turnin' her back to my face?
Without any doubt, she seems too far out
For me to return to or chase
Well her skirt it swayed as the guitar played
Her mouth was watery and wet
But now something has changed, for she ain't the same
She just acts like we never have met

If I didn’t have to guess, I’d gladly confess
To anything I might’ve tried
If I was with her too long or have done something wrong
I'd wish she’d tell me what it is, I’ll run and hide
Though the night ran swirling and whirling
I remember her whispering yet
But evidently she don’t, evidently she won’t
She just acts like we never have met

I’m leavin' today, I’ll be on my way
Of this I can't say very much
But if you want me to, I can be just like you
And pretend that we never have touched
And if anybody asks me
“Is it easy to forget?”
I’ll say, “It’s easily done, you just pick anyone
And pretend that you never have met!”1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Series of Dreams,"I was thinking of a series of dreams
Where nothing comes up to the top
Everything stays down where it’s wounded
And comes to a permanent stop
Wasn’t thinking of anything specific
Like in a dream, when someone wakes up and screams
Nothing too very scientific
Just thinking of a series of dreams

Thinking of a series of dreams
Where the time and the tempo fly
And there’s no exit in any direction
’Cept the one that you can’t see with your eyes
Wasn’t making any great connection
Wasn’t falling for any intricate scheme
Nothing that would pass inspection
Just thinking of a series of dreams

Dreams where the umbrella is folded
Into the path you are hurled
And the cards are no good that you’re holding
Unless they’re from another world
In one, numbers were burning
In another, I witnessed a crime
In one, I was running, and in another
All I seemed to be doing was climb
Wasn’t looking for any special assistance
Not going to any great extremes
I’d already gone the distance
Just thinking of a series of dreamsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Let Me Die in My Footsteps,"I will not go down under the ground
’Cause somebody tells me that death’s coming 'round
An’ I will not carry myself down to die
When I go to my grave my head will be high

Let me die in my footsteps
Before I go down under the ground

There’s been rumors of war and wars that have been
The meaning of life has been lost in the wind
And some people thinking that the end is close by
’Stead of learning to live they are learning to die

Let me die in my footsteps
Before I go down under the ground

I don’t know if I’m smart but I think I can see
When someone is pulling the wool over me
And if this war comes and death’s all around
Let me die on this land ’fore I die underground
Let me die in my footsteps
Before I go down under the ground

There’s always been people that have to cause fear
They’ve been talking about war now for many long years
I have read all their statements and I’ve not said a word
But now Lawd God, let my poor voice be heard

Let me die in my footsteps
Before I go down under the ground

Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green grassy leaves
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace

Let me die in my footsteps
Before I go down under the ground

Go out in your country where the land meets the sun
See the craters and the canyons where the waterfalls run
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho
Let every state in this union seep down deep in your souls
And you’ll die in your footsteps
Before you go down under the ground6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

On the pages and the text

Up to Me,"Everything went from bad to worse, money never changed a thing
Death kept following, tracking us down, at least I heard your bluebird sing
Now somebody’s got to show their hand, time is an enemy
I know you’re long gone, I guess it must be up to me

If I’d thought about it I never would’ve done it, I guess I would’ve let it slide
If I'd-a paid attention to what others were thinking, the heart inside me would’ve died
But I was just too stubborn to ever be governed by enforced insanity
Someone had to reach for the rising star, I guess it was up to me

Now the Union Central is pulling out, the orchids are in bloom
I’ve only got me one good shirt left and it smells of stale perfume
In fourteen months I’ve only smiled once and I didn’t do it consciously
Somebody’s got to find your trail, I guess it's gonna be up to me

It was like a revelation when you betrayed me with your touch
I’d just about convinced myself nothing had changed that much
The old Rounder in the iron mask, he slipped me the master key
Somebody had to unlock your heart, he said it was up to me

Now I watched you slowly disappear down into the officers’ club
I would’ve followed you in the door, but I didn’t have a ticket stub
So I waited all night ’til the break of day, hoping one of us could get free
When the dawn came over the river bridge, I knew it was up to me
The only decent thing I did when I worked as a postal clerk
Was to haul your picture down off the wall near the cage where I used to work
Was I a fool or not to protect your real identity?
You looked a little burned out my friend, I thought it might be up to me

I met somebody face to face, I had to remove my hat
She’s everything I need and love, but I can’t be swayed by that
It frightens me, the awful truth, of how sweet life can be
But she ain’t goin' to make a move, I guess it must be up to me

Now we heard the Sermon on the Mount, and I knew it was too complex
It didn’t amount to anything more than what the broken glass reflects
When you bite off more than you can chew, you got to pay the penalty
Somebody’s got to tell the tale, I guess it must be up to me

Dupree came in pimpin’ tonight to the Thunderbird Café
Crystal wanted to talk to him, I had to look the other way
Now I just can’t rest without you, love, I need your company
You ain’t goin' to cross the line, I guess it must be up to me

There’s a note left in the bottle, you can give it to Estelle
She’s the one you been wondering about, but there’s really nothing much to tell
We both heard voices for a while, now the rest is history
Somebody’s got to cry some tears, I guess it must be up to me
So go on boys, play your hands, life is a pantomime
The ringleaders from the county seat say you don’t have all that much time
And the girl with me behind the shades, she ain’t my property
One of us has got to hit the road, I guess it must be up to me

If we never meet again, baby, remember me
How my lone guitar played sweet for you that old-time melody
And the harmonica around my neck, I blew it for you, free
No one else could play that tune, you knew it was up to meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Silver Bells,"City sidewalk, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style

Children laughing, people passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear

Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

City street lights, even stop lights
Blink a bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures
Hear the snow crunch, see the kids bunch
This is Santa's big scene
And above all this bustle you'll hear

Silver bells, silver bells

Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

Wedding Song,"I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love
I love you more than money and more than the stars above
Love you more than madness, more than waves upon the sea
Love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me

Ever since you walked right in, the circle’s been complete
I’ve said goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street
To the courtyard of the jester which is hidden from the sun
I love you more than ever and I haven’t yet begun

You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live
When I was deep in poverty you taught me how to give
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole
Quenched my thirst and satisfied the burning in my soul

You gave me babies one, two, three, what is more, you saved my life
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife
My thoughts of you don’t ever rest, they’d kill me if I lie
I’d sacrifice the world for you and watch my senses die

The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth
We’ll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth
What’s lost is lost, we can’t regain what went down in the flood
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood
It’s never been my duty to remake the world at large
Nor is it my intention to sound a battle charge
’Cause I love you more than all of that with a love that doesn’t bend
And if there is eternity I’d love you there again

Oh, can’t you see that you were born to stand by my side
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride
You’re the other half of what I am, you’re the missing piece
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn’t cease

You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see
Just being’ next to you is a natural thing for me
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on
‘Cause I love you more than ever now that the past is gone2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
You’re No Good,"Well, I don't know why I love you like I do
Nobody in the world can get along with you
You got the ways of a devil sleeping in a lion's den
I come home last night you wouldn't even let me in

Oh sometimes you're as sweet as anybody want to be
Oh when you get the crazy notion of jumping all over me
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied
When you give me the blues I want to lay down and die


I helped you when you had no shoes on your feet, pretty mama
I helped you when you had no food to eat
Now you're the kind of woman that just don't understand
You're taking all my money and give it to another man

Well, you're that kind of woman makes a man lose his brains
You're that kind of woman drives a man insane
Well, you give me the blues, I guess you're satisfied
You give me the blues, I want to lay down and die1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Shooting Star,"Seen a shooting star tonight
And I thought of you
You were trying to break into another world
A world I never knew
I always kind of wondered
If you ever made it through
Seen a shooting star tonight
And I thought of you

Seen a shooting star tonight
And I thought of me
If I was still the same
If I ever became what you wanted me to be
Did I miss the mark or overstep the line
That only you could see?
Seen a shooting star tonight
And I thought of me

Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
As the last fire truck from hell
Goes rolling by
All good people are praying
It’s the last temptation, the last account
The last time you might hear the sermon on the mount
The last radio is playing
Seen a shooting star tonight
Slip away
Tomorrow will be
Another day
Guess it’s too late to say the things to you
That you needed to hear me say
Seen a shooting star tonight
Slip awayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Precious Angel,"Precious angel
Under the sun
How was I to know
You'd be the one
To show me I was blinded
To show me I was gone
How weak was the foundation
I was standing upon?
Now there's spiritual warfare
And flesh and blood breaking down
You either got faith or you got unbelief
And there is no neutral ground
The enemy is subtle
How be it we are so deceived
When the truth's in our hearts
And we still don't believe?

Shine your light, shine your light on me
Shine your light, shine your light on me
Shine your light, shine your light on me
You know I just couldn't make it by myself
I'm a little too blind to see
My so-called friends
Have fallen under a spell
They look me squarely in the eye
And they say, ""All is well""
Can they imagine the darkness
That will fall from on high
When men will beg God to kill them
And they won't be able to die?
Sister, let me tell you
About a vision that I saw
You were drawing water for your husband
You were suffering under the law
You were telling him about Buddha
You were telling him about Mohammed, in one breath
You never mentioned one time
The Man who came and died a criminal's death

Shine your light, shine your light on me
Shine your light, shine your light on me
Shine your light, shine your light on me
You know I just couldn't make it by myself
I'm a little too blind to see
Precious angel
You believe me when I say
What God has given to us
No man can take away
We are covered in blood, girl
You know both our forefathers were slaves
Let us hope they've found mercy
In their bone-filled graves
You're the queen of my flesh, girl
You're my woman, you're my delight
You're the lamp of my soul, girl
And you torch up the night
But there's violence in the eyes, girl
So let us not be enticed
On the way out of Egypt
Through Ethiopia
To the judgment hall of Christ

Shine your light, shine your light on me
Shine your light, shine your light on me
Shine your light, shine your light on me
You know I just couldn't make it by myself
I'm a little too blind to see
(Shine your light, shine your light on me)
(Shine your light, shine your light on me)
(Shine your light, shine your light on me)
(Shine your light, shine your light on me)
(Shine your light, shine your light on me)
(Shine your light, shine your light on me)
(Shine your light, shine your light on me)
(Shine your light, shine your light on me)EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
In the Pines,"Little girl, little Girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night?
In the pines, In the pines
Where the sun never shine
I shivered the whole night through
Little girl, little girl, where will you go
I'm going where the cold wind blows
In the pines, In the pines
Where the sun never shine
I will shiver the whole night through
Little girl, Little Girl, don't lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night?
In the pines, In the pines
Where the sun never shine
I shivered the whole night through
My Husband was a Railroad man
Killed a mile and a half from here
His head, was found, In a drivers wheel
And his body hasn't never been found
Little girl, little girl, where will you go
I'm going where the cold wind blows
You called me weak, and you called me the most
You called rita, bring me back homeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Can’t Wait,"I can’t wait, wait for you to change your mind
It’s late, I’m trying to walk the line
Well, it’s way past midnight and there are people all around
Some on their way up, some on their way down
The air burns and I’m trying to think straight
And I don’t know how much longer I can wait

I’m your man, I’m trying to recover the sweet love that we knew
You understand that my heart can’t go on beating without you
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I’m reeling from the blow
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so
I’m breathing hard, standing at the gate
But I don’t know how much longer I can wait

Skies are grey, I’m looking for anything that will bring a happy glow
Night or day, it doesn’t matter where I go anymore, I just go
If I ever saw you coming I don’t know what I would do
I’d like to think I could control myself, but it isn’t true
That’s how it is when things disintegrate
And I don’t know how much longer I can wait

I’m doomed to love you, I’ve been rolling through stormy weather
I’m thinking of you and all the places we could roam together
It’s mighty funny, the end of time has just begun
Oh, honey, after all these years you’re still the one
While I’m strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate
But I don’t know how much longer I can wait1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Watching the River Flow,"What’s the matter with me
I don’t have much to say
Daylight sneaking through the window
And I’m still in this all-night café
Walking to and fro beneath the moon
Out to where the trucks are rolling slow
To sit down on this bank of sand
And watch the river flow

Wish I was back in the city
Instead of this old bank of sand
With the sun beating down over the chimney tops
And the one I love so close at hand
If I had wings and I could fly
I know where I would go
But right now I’ll just sit here so contentedly
And watch the river flow

People disagreeing on all just about everything, yeah
Makes you stop and all wonder why
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street
Who just couldn’t help but cry
Oh, this old river keeps on rolling, though
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
And as long as it does I’ll just sit here
And watch the river flow
People disagreeing everywhere you look
Makes you want to stop and read a book
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street
That was really shook
But this old river keeps on rolling, though
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
And as long as it does I’ll just sit here
And watch the river flow

Watch the river flow
Watching the river flow
Watching the river flow
But I’ll sit down on this bank of sand
And watch the river flowEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
"Tangled Up in Blue (Take 3, Remake 2)","Early one mornin' the sun was shinin'
He was lyin' in bed
Wondrin' if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red
Her folks they said their lives together
Sure was gonna be rough
They never did like mama's homemade dress
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
And he was standin' on the side of the road
Rain fallin' on his shoes
Headin' out for the old East Coast
Lord knows he's paid some dues, gettin' through
Tangled up in blue

She was married when they first met
Soon to be divorced
He helped her out of a jam I guess
But he used a little too much force
And they drove that car as far as they could
Abandoned it out west
And split up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best
And she turned around to look at him
As he was walkin' away
She said, ""This can't be the end
We'll meet on another day, on the avenue
Tangled up in blue.""
He had a job in the old north woods
Workin' as a cook for a spell
But he never did like it all that much
And one day the axe just fell
When he drifted down to L.A
Where he reckoned to try his luck
Workin' for a while in an airplane plant
Loadin' cargo onto a truck
But all the while he was alone
The past was close behind
He seen a lot of women
But she never escaped his mind and he just grew
Tangled up in blue

She was workin' in a topless place
I stopped in for a beer
I just kept lookin' at the side of her face
In the spotlight so clear
And later on as the crowd thinned out
I's about to do the same
She was standin' there, in back of my chair
Said, ""Tell me, what's your name?""
I muttered somethin' underneath my breath
She studied the lines of my face
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe
Tangled up in blue
She lit a burner on the stove
And offered me a pipe
""Thought you'd never say hello,"" she said
""You look like the silent type""
Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century
And every one of them words rang true
And flowed like burning coal
Pourin' off of every page
Like it was written in my soul from me to you
Tangled up in blue

He was always in a hurry
Too busy or too stoned
And everything that she ever planned
Just had to be postponed
He thought they were successful
She thought they were blessed
With objects and material things
But I never was impressed
And when it all came crashin' down
I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do
Was keep on keepin' on like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue
So now I'm goin' back again
I got to get to her somehow
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now
Some are mathematicians
Some are doctors' wives
Don't know how it all got started
Don't know what they're doin' with their lives
But me, I'm still on the road
Headin' for another joint
We always did feel the same
We just saw it from a different point of view
Tangled up in blueEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Ain’t Talkin’,"As I walked out tonight in the mystic garden
The wounded flowers were danglin' from the vine
I was passin' by yon cool and crystal fountain
Someone hit me from behind

Ain't talkin', just a'walkin'
Through this weary world of woe
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
No one on earth would ever know

They say prayer has the power to help
So pray from the mother
In the human heart an evil spirit can dwell
I'm a'tryin' to love my neighbor and do good unto others
But oh, mother, things ain't goin' well

Ain't talkin', just a'walkin'
I'll burn that bridge before you can cross
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
They'll be no mercy for ya' once you've lost

Now I'm all worn down by weepin'
My eyes are filled with tears, my lips are dry
If I catch my opponents ever sleepin'
I'll just slaughter them where they lie
Ain't talkin', just a'walkin'
Through the world mysterious and vague
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
Walkin' a'through the cities of the plague

Well, the whole world is filled with speculation
The whole wide world which people say is round
They will tear your mind away from contemplation
They will jump on your misfortune when you're down

Ain't talkin', just a'walkin'
Eatin' hog-eyed grease in a hog-eyed town
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
Someday you'll be glad to have me around

They will crush you with wealth and power
Every wakin' moment you could crack
I'll make the most of one last extra hour
I'll avenge my father's death an' I'll step back

Ain't talkin', just walkin'
Hand me down my walkin' cane
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
Got to get ya' out of my miserable brain
All o' my loyal and much-loved companions
They approve of me and share my code
I practice a faith that's been long abandoned
Ain't no altars on this long and lonesome road

Ain't talkin', just a'walkin'
My mule is sick, my horse is blind
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
Thinkin' ‘bout that gal I left behind

Well, it's bright in the heavens and the wheels are flyin'
Fame and honor never seem to fade
The fire gone out but the light is never dyin'
Who says I can't get heavenly aid?

Ain't talkin', just a'walkin'
Carryin' a dead man's shield
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
A'walkin' a'with a toothache in my heel

The sufferin' is unending
Every nook and cranny has its tears
I'm a'not playin', I'm not pretending
I'm not nursin' any superfluous fears
Ain't talkin', just a'walkin'
Walkin' ever since the other night
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
Walkin' ‘til I'ma clean outta sight

As I walked out in the mystic garden
On a hot summer day, a hot summer lawn
""Excuse me, ma'am, I beg your pardon
There's no one here, the gardener is gone""

Ain't talkin', a'just a'walkin'
Up the road around the bend
Heart burnin', still yearnin'
In the last outback, at the world's endEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Til I Fell in Love with You,"Well, my nerves are exploding and my body’s tense
I feel like the whole world got me pinned up against the fence
I’ve been hit too hard, I’ve seen too much
Nothing can heal me now, but your touch
I don’t know what I’m gonna do
I was all right ’til I fell in love with you

Well, my house is on fire, burning to the sky
I thought it would rain but the clouds passed by
Now I feel like I’m coming to the end of my way
But I know God is my shield and he won’t lead me astray
Still I don’t know what I’m gonna do
I was all right ’til I fell in love with you

Boys in the street beginning to play
Girls like birds flying away
When I’m gone you will remember my name
I’m gonna win my way to wealth and fame
I don’t know what I’m gonna do
I was all right ’til I fell in love with you

Junk is piling up, taking up space
My eyes feel like they’re falling off my face
Sweat falling down, I’m staring at the floor
I’m thinking about that girl who won’t be back no more
I just don't know what to do
I was all right ’til I fell in love with you
Well, I’m tired of talking, I’m tired of trying to explain
My attempts to please you were all in vain
Tomorrow night before the sun goes down
If I’m still among the living, I’ll be Dixie bound
I just don’t know what I’m gonna do
I was all right ’til I fell in love with youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Dear Landlord,"Dear landlord
Please don’t put a price on my soul
My burden is heavy
My dreams are beyond control
When that steamboat whistle blows
I’m gonna give you all I got to give
And I do hope you receive it well
Depending on the way you feel that you live

Dear landlord
Please heed these words that I speak
I know you’ve suffered much
But in this you are not so unique
All of us, at times, we might work too hard
To have it too fast and too much
And anyone can fill his life up
With things he can see but he just cannot touch

Dear landlord
Please don’t dismiss my case
I’m not about to argue
I’m not about to move to no other place
Now, each of us has his own special gift
And you know this was meant to be true
And if you don’t underestimate me
I won’t underestimate youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Million Miles,"You took a part of me that I really miss
I keep asking myself how long it can go on like this
You told yourself a lie, that’s all right mama I told myself one too
I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you

You took the silver, you took the gold
You left me standing out in the cold
People ask about you, I didn’t tell them everything I knew
Well, I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you

I’m drifting in and out of dreamless sleep
Throwing all my memories in a ditch so deep
Did so many things I never did intend to do
Well, I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you

I need your love so bad, turn your lamp down low
I need every bit of it for the places that I go
Sometimes I wonder just what it’s all coming to
Well, I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you

Well, I don’t dare close my eyes and I don’t dare wink
Maybe in the next life I’ll be able to hear myself think
Feel like talking to somebody but I just don’t know who
Well, I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you
The last thing you said before you hit the street
“Gonna find me a janitor to sweep me off my feet”
I said, “That’s all right mama you  you do what you gotta do”
Well, I’m trying to get closer. I’m still a million miles from you

Rock me, pretty baby; rock me ’till everything gets real
Rock me for a little while; rock me ’till there’s nothing left to feel
And I’ll rock you too
I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from you

Well, there’s voices in the night trying to be heard
I’m sitting here listening to every mind-polluting word
I know plenty of people who would put me up for a day or two
Yes, I’m trying to get closer but I’m still a million miles from youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Talkin’ Bear Mountain Picnic Massacre Blues,"Well, I saw it advertised one day
That the Bear Mountain picnic was coming my way
""Come along and take a trip
We'll bring you up there on a ship
Bring the wife and family
Bring the whole kids""
Yippee

Well, I run right down and bought a ticket
To this thing called the Bear Mountain picnic
Little did I realize
I was in for a pleasant, funny surprise
Had nothing to do with picnic
Didn't come close to a mountain
And I hate bears

Took the wife and kids down to the pier
There was six thousand people there
Everybody had a ticket for the trip
""Oh well,"" I said ""it's a pretty big ship
Besides, anyhow, the more the merrier""

Well, we all got on, and what do you think?
That big old boat started to sink
More people kept a-piling on
That old ship was a-going down
Funny way to start a picnic
Well, I soon lost track of my kids and wife
So many people, I never saw in my life
That old ship was sinking down in the water
There was six thousand people trying to kill each other
Dogs a-barking, cats a-screaming
Women a-yelling, men a-flying, fists a-flying
Paper flying, cops a-coming, me a-running
Maybe we just better call off the picnic

I got shoved down, got pushed around
All I remember was a moanin' sound
Don't remember one thing more
All I remember is waking up on the shore
My arms and legs were broken
My feet were splintered
My head was cracked
I couldn't walk
I couldn't talk, smell, feel
Couldn't see
Didn't know where I was
I was bald
Quite lucky to be alive though

Well, feeling like I just climbed out of my casket
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket
Took the wife and kids and started home
Wishing I'd never got up that mornin'
Now, I don't care just what you do
If you want a have a picnic, that's up to you
But don't tell me about it, I don't want to hear it
You see, I just lost all my picnic spirit
Stay in my kitchen, have my own picnic
Have a picnic in the bathroom

Well, it don't seem to me quite so funny
What some people are going to do for money
There's a brand new gimmick every day
Just to take somebody's money away
I think we ought to take some of these people
And put them on a boat, send them up to Bear Mountain
For a picnic2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
She’s Your Lover Now,"The pawnbroker roared
Also, so, so did the landlord
The scene was so crazy, wasn’t it?
Both were so glad
To watch me destroy what I had
Pain sure brings out the best in people, doesn’t it?
Why didn’t you just leave me if you didn’t want to stay?
Why’d you have to treat me so bad?
Did it have to be that way?
Now you stand here expectin’ me to remember something’ you forgot to say
Yes, and you, I see you’re still with her, well
That’s fine ’cause she’s comin’ on so strange, can’t you tell?
Somebody had better explain
She’s got her iron chain
I’d do it, but I, I just can’t remember how
You talk to her
She’s your lover now

I already assumed
That we’re in the felony room
But I ain’t a judge, you don’t have to be nice to me
But please tell that
To your friend in the cowboy hat
You know he keeps on saying’ everything’ twice to me
You know I was straight with you
You know I’ve never tried to change you in any way
You know if you didn’t want to be with me
That you could, didn’t have to stay
Now you stand here sayin’ you forgive and forget. Honey, what can I say?
Yes, you, you just sit around and ask for ashtrays, can’t you reach?
I see you kiss her on the cheek ev’rytime she gives a speech
With her picture books of the pyramid
And her postcards of Billy the Kid (why must everybody bow?)
You better talk to her ’bout it
You’re her lover now
Oh, everybody that cares
Is going up the castle stairs
But I’m not up in your castle, honey
It’s true, I just can’t recall
San Francisco at all
I can’t even remember El Paso, uh, honey
You never had to be faithful
I never wanted you to grieve
Oh, why was it so hard for you
If you didn’t want to be with me, just to leave?
Now you stand here while your finger’s going’ up my sleeve
An’ you, just what do you do anyway?
Ain’t there nothing’ you can say?
She’ll be standing’ on the bar soon
With a fish head and a harpoon
And a fake beard plastered on her brow
You’d better do something quick
She’s your lover now

Oh, why must I fall into this sadness?
Do I look like Charles Atlas?
Do you think I still got what you still got baby?
My voice is really warm
It's just there, it ain't got no form
But it's just like a dead man's last pistol shot, baby
Ah, your mouth used to be so naked
Your eyes used to be so blue
Your hurts used to be so nameless
And your tears used to be so few
Now your mouth cries wolf
While... (What?)1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Once Upon a Time,"Once upon a time
A girl with moonlight in her eyes
Put her hand in mine
And said she loved me so
But that was once upon a time
Very long ago
Once upon a hill
We sat beneath a willow tree
Counting all the stars and waiting for the dawn
But that was once upon a time
Now the tree is gone
How the breeze ruffled through her hair
How we always laughed as though tomorrow wasn't there
We were young and didn't have a care
Where did it go
Once upon a time
The world was sweeter than we knew
Everything was ours
How happy we were then
But somehow once upon a time
Never comes again
Once upon a time
Never comes againEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Nettie Moore,"Lost John sitting on a railroad track
Something's out of whack
Blues this morning falling down like hail
Gonna leave a greasy trail

Gonna travel the world is what I'm gonna do
Then come back and see you
All I ever do is struggle and strive
If I don't do anybody any harm, I might make it back home alive

I'm the oldest son of a crazy man
I'm in a cowboy band
Got a pile of sins to pay for and I ain't got time to hide
I'd walk through a blazing fire, baby, if I knew you was on the other side

Oh, I miss you Nettie Moore
And my happiness is o'er
Winter's gone, the river's on the rise
I loved you then and ever shall
But there's no one here left to tell
The world has gone black before my eyes
The world of research has gone berserk
Too much paperwork
Albert's in the graveyard, Frankie's raising hell
I'm beginning to believe what the scriptures tell

I'm going where the Southern crosses the Yellow Dog
Get away from these demagogues
And these bad luck women stick like glue
It's either one or the other or neither of the two

She says, ""look out daddy, don't want you to tear your pants
You can get wrecked in this dance.""
They say whiskey will kill ya, but I don't think it will
I'm riding with you to the top of the hill

Oh, I miss you Nettie Moore
And my happiness is o'er
Winter's gone, the river's on the rise
I loved you then and ever shall
But there's no one here left to tell
The world has gone black before my eyes
Don't know why my baby never looked so good before
I don't have to wonder no more
She been cooking all day and it's gonna take me all night
I can't eat all that stuff in a single bite

The Judge is coming in, everybody rise
Lift up your eyes
You can do what you please, you don't need my advice
Before you call me any dirty names you better think twice

Getting light outside, the temperature dropped
I think the rain has stopped
I'm going to make you come to grips with fate
When I'm through with you, you'll learn to keep your business straight

Oh, I miss you Nettie Moore
And my happiness is o'er
Winter's gone, the river's on the rise
I loved you then and ever shall
But there's no one here left to tell
The world has gone black before my eyes
The bright spark of the steady lights
Has dimmed my sights
When you're around all my grief gives 'way
A lifetime with you is like some heavenly day

Everything I've ever known to be right has been proven wrong
I'll be drifting along
The woman I'm a-loving, she rules my heart
No knife could ever cut our love apart

Today I'll stand in faith and raise
The voice of praise
The sun is strong, I'm standing in the light
I wish to God that it were night

Oh, I miss you Nettie Moore
And my happiness is o'er
Winter's gone, the river's on the rise
I loved you then and ever shall
But there's no one here left to tell
The world has gone black before my eyesEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
One More Night,"One more night, the stars are in sight
But tonight I'm as lonesome as can be
Oh, the moon is shinin' bright
Lighting everything in sight
But tonight no light will shine on me

Oh, it's shameful and it's sad I lost the only pal I had
I just could not be what she wanted me to be
I will turn my head up high
To that dark and rollin' sky
For tonight no light will shine on me

I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true
I had no idea what a woman in love would do

One more night, I will wait for the light
While the wind blows high above the tree
Oh, I miss my darlin' so
I didn't mean to see her go
But tonight no light will shine on me

And the wind blows high above the tree
Oh, I miss that woman so

Well, she needs me here
All aware I can't hear her walk
I just cannot hear her talk
Though sometimes, you know you will
And when she comes my way
I'll just be left any night or day
I will hear her say
That I don't wanna try
I tried, also cried
But I can't leave her behindEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
What Good Am I?,"What good am I if I’m like all the rest
If I just turn away, when I see how you’re dressed
If I shut myself off so I can’t hear you cry
What good am I?

What good am I if I know and don’t do
If I see and don’t say, if I look right through you
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky
What good am I?

What good am I while you softly weep
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don’t try
What good am I?

What good am I then to others and me
If I’ve had every chance and yet still fail to see
If my hands are tied must I not wonder within
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?

What good am I if I say foolish things
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
And I just turn my back while you silently die
What good am I?1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
High Water (For Charley Patton),"High water risin'
Risin' night and day
All the gold and silver
Are being stolen away
Big Joe Turner lookin' East and West
From the dark room of his mind
He made it to Kansas City
Twelfth Street and Vine
Nothing standing there
High water everywhere

High water risin'
The shacks are slidin' down
Folks lose their possessions
Folks are leaving town
Bertha Mason shook it, broke it
Then she hung it on a wall
Says, ""You're dancin' with whom they tell you to
Or you don't dance at all.""
It's tough out there
High water everywhere

I got a cravin' love for blazing speed
Got a hopped up Mustang Ford
Jump into the wagon, love
Throw your panties overboard
I can write you poems
Make a strong man lose his mind
I'm no pig without a wig
I hope you treat me kind
Things are breakin' up out there
High water everywhere
High water risin'
Six inches 'bove my head
Coffins droppin' in the street
Like balloons made out of lead
Water pourin' into Vicksburg
Don't know what I'm going to do
""Don't reach out for me,"" she said
""Can't you see I'm drownin' too?""
It's rough out there
High water everywhere

Well, George Lewis told the Englishman
The Italian and the Jew
""You can't open your mind, boys
To every conceivable point of view.""
They got Charles Darwin trapped out there on Highway Five
Judge says to the High Sheriff
""I want him dead or alive
Either one, I don't care.""
High Water everywhere

The Cuckoo is a pretty bird
She warbles as she flies
I'm preachin' the Word of God
I'm puttin' out your eyes
I asked Fat Nancy for something to eat
She said, ""Take it off the shelf
As great as you are, man
You'll never be greater than yourself.""
I told her I didn't really care
High water everywhere
I'm getting' up in the morning
I believe I'll dust my broom
Keeping away from the women
I'm givin' 'em lots of room
Thunder rolling over Clarksdale
Everything is looking blue
I just can't be happy, love
Unless you're happy too
It's bad out there
High water everywhere1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Spirit on the Water,"Spirit on the water
Darkness on the face of the deep
I keep thinking about you baby
I can't hardly sleep

I'm traveling by land
Traveling through the dawn of day
You're always on my mind
I can't stay away

I'd forgotten about you
Then you turned up again
I always knew
That we were meant to be more than friends

When you are near
It's just as plain as it can be
I'm wild about you, gal
You ought to be a fool about me

Can't explain
The sources of this hidden pain
You burned your way into my heart
You got the key to my brain
I've been trampling through mud
Praying to the powers above
I'm sweating blood
You got a face that begs for love

Life without you
Doesn't mean a thing to me
If I can't have you
I'll throw my love into the deep blue sea

Sometimes I wonder
Why you can't treat me right
You do good all day
Then you do wrong all night

When you're with me
I'm a thousand times happier than I could ever say
What does it matter
What price I pay

They brag about your sugar
Brag about it all over town
Put some sugar in my bowl
I feel like laying down
I'm pale as a ghost
Holding a blossom on a stem
You ever seen a ghost? No
But you have heard of them

I see you there
I'm blinded by the colors I see
I take good care
Of what belongs to me

I hear your name
Ringing up and down the line
I'm saying it plain
These ties are strong enough to bind

Your sweet voice
Calls out from some old familiar shrine
I got no choice
Can't believe these things would ever fade from your mind

I could live forever
With you perfectly
You don't ever
Have to make a fuss over me
From East to West
Ever since the world began
I only mean it for the best
I want to be with you any way I can

I been in a brawl
Now I'm feeling the wall
I'm going away baby
I won't be back ‘till fall

High on the hill
You can carry all my thoughts with you
You've numbed my will
This love could tear me in two

I wanna be with you in paradise
And it seems so unfair
I can't go to paradise no more
I killed a man back there

You think I'm over the hill
You think I'm past my prime
Let me see what you got
We can have a whoppin' good time2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Shenandoah,"Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you
Look away, you rolling river
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you
Look away. We're bound away
Across the wide Missouri

Now the Missouri is a mighty river
Look away, you rolling river
Indians camp along her border
Look away. We're bound away
Across the wide Missouri

Well a white man loved an Indian maiden
Look away, you rolling river
With notions his canoe was laden
Look away, we're bound away
Across the wide Missouri

Oh Shenandoah, I love your daughter
Look away, you rolling river
It was for her I'd cross the water
Look away, we're bound away
Across the wide Missouri
For seven long years I courted Sally
Look away, you rolling river
Seven more years I longed to have her
Look away, we're bound away

I'm bound to leave you
Look away you rolling river
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you
Look away, we're bound away

Tweedle Dee & Tweedle Dum,"Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee

Two big bags of dead man’s bones
Got their noses to the grindstones

Living in the Land of Nod
Trustin’ their fate to the Hands of God
They pass by so silently
Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee

Well, they’re going to the country, they’re gonna retire
They’re taking a street car named Desire
Looking in the window at the pecan pie
Lot of things they’d like they would never buy

Neither one gonna turn and run
They’re making a voyage to the sun
“His Master’s voice is calling me”
Says Tweedle-dee Dum to Tweedle-dee Dee

Tweedle-dee Dee and Tweedle-dee Dum
All that and more and then some
They walk among the stately trees
They know the secrets of the breeze
Tweedle-dee Dum said to Tweedle-dee Dee
“Your presence is obnoxious to me”
They’re like babies sittin’ on a woman’s knee
Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee

Well, the rain beating down on my window pane
I got love for you and it’s all in vain
Brains in the pot, they’re beginning to boil
They’re dripping with garlic and olive oil

Tweedle-dee Dee—he’s on his hands and his knees
Saying, “Throw me somethin’, Mister, please”
“What’s good for you is good for me”
Says Tweedle-dee Dum to Tweedle-dee Dee

Well, they’re living in a happy harmony
Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee
They’re one day older and a dollar short
They’ve got a parade permit and a police escort

They’re lying low and they’re makin’ hay
They seem determined to go all the way
They run a brick-and-tile company
Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee
Well a childish dream is a deathless need
And a noble truth is a sacred dream
My pretty baby, she’s lookin’ around
She’s wearin’ a multi-thousand dollar gown

Tweedle-dee Dee is a lowdown, sorry old man
Tweedle-dee Dum, he’ll stab you where you stand

Blue Moon,"Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own

Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for someone I really could care for

And suddenly there appeared before me the only one my arms could ever hold
I heard someone whisper, ""Please, adore me""
And when I looked my moon had turned to gold

Blue moon, now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own
Without a love of my ownEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
I Believe in You,"They ask me how I feel
And if my love is real
And how I know I'll make it through
And they, they look at me and frown
They'd like to drive me from this town
They don't want me around
Because I believe in you

They, they show me to the door
They say, ""Don't come back no more""
'Cause I don't be like they'd like me to
And I, I walk out on my own
A thousand miles from home
But I don't feel alone
Because I believe in you

I believe in you even through the tears and the laughter
L believe in you even though we be apart
I believe in you even on the morning after
Oh, when the dawn is nearing
Oh, when the night is disappearing
Oh, this feeling is still here in my heart
Don't let me drift too far
Keep me where you are
Where I will always be renewed
And that which you've given me today
Is worth more than I could pay
And no matter what they say
I believe in you

L believe in you when winter turns to summer
I believe in you when white turn to black
I believe in you even though I be outnumbered
Oh, though the earth may shake me
Oh, though my friends forsake me
Oh, even that couldn't make me go back

Don't let me change my heart
Keep me set apart
From all the plans they do pursue
And I, I don't mind the pain
Don't mind the driving rain
I know I will sustain

Well, I’m standing on the table, I’m proposing a toast to the king
Well I’m driving in the flats in a Cadillac car
The girls all say, “You’re a worn-out star”
My pockets are loaded and I’m spending every dime
How can you say you love someone else when you know it’s me all the time?

Well, the fog’s so thick you can’t spy the land
The fog is so thick that you can’t even spy the land
What good are you anyway, if you can’t stand up to some old businessman?
Wedding bells are ringing, the choir is beginning to sing
Yes, the wedding bells are ringing and the choir's beginning to sing
What looked good in the day, at night is another thing
She’s looking into my eyes, she’s-a holding my hand
She looking into my eyes, she’s holding my hand
She said, “You can’t repeat the past,” I said, “You can’t? What do you mean
You can’t? Of course you can.”
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
Sorry that’s nothing you would need to know
Well, my back has been to the wall for so long, it seems like it’s stuck
Why don’t you break my heart one more time just for good luck?
I got eight carburetors, boys I’m using ’em all
Well, I got eight carburetors and boys, I’m using ’em all
I’m short on gas, my motor’s starting to stall
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around
My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around
I got my hammer ringing, pretty baby, but the nails ain’t going down
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace
If it’s information you want you can get it from the police
Politician's got on his jogging shoes
He must be running for office, got no time to lose
He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity
You been rolling your eyes—you been teasing me

Day of the Locusts,"Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration
The birdies were flying from tree to tree

As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree
And the locusts sang off in the distance
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me

I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking
Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb
I was ready to leave, I was already walking
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody
Oh, the locusts sang their high whining trill
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me

Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading
The weather was hot, a-nearly 90 degrees
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn’t fall on me
Yeah, the locusts sang off in the distance
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me
I put down my robe, picked up my diploma
Took hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota
Sure was glad to get out of there alive
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody
And the locusts sang with a high whining trill
Yeah, the locusts sang and they was singing for me
Singing for me, well, singing for meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Can’t Help Falling in Love,"Wise men say, only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay, will it be a sin
If I can't help falling in love with you ?

Like a river flows surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be
Take my hand, take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
I’ll Keep It with Mine,"You will search, babe
At any cost
But how long, babe
Can you search for what is not lost?
Everybody will help you
Some people are very kind
But if I can save you any time
Come on, give it to me
I'll keep it with mine

I can't help it
If you might think I am odd
If I say I'm loving you not for what you are
But for what you're not
Everybody will help you
Discover what you set out to find
But if I can save you any time
Come on, give it to me
I'll keep it with mine

The train leaves
At half past ten
But it will be back
In the same old spot again
The conductor
He's still stuck on the line
And if I can save you any time
Come on, give it to me

Nashville Skyline Rag,
New Morning,"Can’t you hear that rooster crowing?
Rabbit running down across the road
Underneath the bridge where the water flowed through
So happy just to see you smile
Underneath the sky of blue
On this new morning, new morning
On this new morning with you

Can’t you hear that motor turning?
Automobile coming into style
Coming down the road for a country mile or two
So happy just to see you smile
Underneath the sky of blue
On this new morning, new morning
On this new morning with you

The night passed away so quickly
It always does when you’re with me

Can’t you feel that sun a-shining?
Ground hog running by the country stream
This must be the day that all of my dreams come true
So happy just to be alive
Underneath the sky of blue
On this new morning, new morning
On this new morning with you
So happy just to be alive
Underneath the sky of blue
On this new morning, new morning
On this new morning with you

When the Deal Goes Down,"In the still of the night, in the world's ancient light
Where wisdom grows up in strife
My bewildering brain, toils in vain
Through the darkness on the pathways of life
Each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air
Tomorrow keeps turning around
We live and we die, we know not why
But I'll be with you when the deal goes down

We eat and we drink, we feel and we think
Far down the street we stray
I laugh and I cry and I'm haunted by
Things I never meant nor wished to say
The midnight rain follows the train
We all wear the same thorny crown
Soul to soul, our shadows roll
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down

The moon gives light and shines by night
I scarcely feel the glow
We learn to live and then we forgive
O'er the road we're bound to go
More frailer than the flowers, these precious hours
That keep us so tightly bound
You come to my eyes like a vision from the skies
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down
I picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes
I followed the winding stream
I heard a deafening noise, I felt transient joys
I know they're not what they seem
In this earthly domain, full of disappointment and pain
You'll never see me frown
I owe my heart to you, and that's saying' it true
And I'll be with you when the deal goes down4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
The Weight,"I pulled into Nazareth, was feeling about half past dead;
I just need some place where I can lay my head
""Hey, mister, can you tell me where a man might find a bed?""
He just grinned and shook my hand, and ""No!"", was all he said

Take a load off Fanny, take a load for free;
Take a load off Fanny, And (and) (and) you can put the load right on me

I picked up my bag, I went looking for a place to hide;
When I saw Carmen and the Devil walking side by side
I said, ""Hey, Carmen, come on, let's go downtown.""
She said, ""I gotta go, but m'friend can stick around.""


Go down, Miss Moses, there's nothing you can say
It's just ol' Luke, and Luke's waitin' on the Judgement Day
""Well, Luke, my friend, what about young Anna Lee?""
He said, ""Do me a favor, son, woncha stay and keep Anna Lee company?""

Crazy Chester followed me, and he caught me in the fog
He said, ""I will fix your rack, if you'll take Jack, my dog.""
I said, ""Wait a minute, Chester, you know I'm a peaceful man.""
He said, ""That's okay, boy, won't you feed him when you can.""


Catch a cannon ball now, t'take me down the line
My bag is sinking' low and I do believe it's time
To get back to Miss Fanny, you know she's the only one
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone

The Wicked Messenger,"There was a wicked messenger
From Eli he did come
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter
When questioned who had sent for him
He answered with his thumb
For his tongue it could not speak, but only flatter

He stayed behind the assembly hall
It was there he made his bed
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
Until one day he just appeared
With a note in his hand which read
“The soles of my feet, I swear they’re burning”

Oh, the leaves began to falling
And the seas began to part
And the people that confronted him were many
And he was told but these few words
Which opened up his heart
“If ye cannot bring good news, then don’t bring any”EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Black Crow Blues,"I woke in the mornin', wandering
Weary and worn out

Weary and worn out

Would walk to me, and talk to me, tell me what it’s all about

I was standin’ at the side road
Listenin’ to the billboard knock
Standin' at the side road
Listenin’ to the billboard knock
Well, my wrist was empty
But my nerves were kickin’, tickin’ like a clock

Well I got anything you need, babe
Let me tell you in front
If I got anything you need, babe
Let me tell you in front
You can come to me sometime
Night time, day time, any time you want

Too high to fall
Sometimes I’m thinkin' I’m
Much too high to fall
Other times I’m thinkin' I’m
So low I don’t know if I can come up at all

Sleepin' across a broad highway

Across a broad highway
Though it’s funny, honey

Drifter’s Escape,"“Oh, help me in my weakness”
I heard the drifter say
As they carried him from the courtroom
And were taking him away
“My trip hasn’t been a pleasant one
And my time it isn’t long
And I still do not know
What it was that I’ve done wrong”

Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside
A tear came to his eye
“You fail to understand,” he said
“Why must you even try?”
Outside, the crowd was stirring
You could hear it from the door
Inside, the judge was stepping down
While the jury cried for more

“Oh, stop that cursed jury”
Cried the attendant and the nurse
“The trial was bad enough
But this is ten times worse”
Just then a bolt of lightning
Struck the courthouse out of shape
And while ev’rybody knelt to pray
The drifter did escapeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Dirt Road Blues,"Gon' walk down that dirt road, ’til someone lets me ride
Gon' walk down that dirt road, ’til someone lets me ride
If I can’t find my baby, I’m gonna run away and hide

Well, I've have been pacing around the room hoping maybe she’d come back
Pacing around the room hoping maybe she’d come back
Well, I have been praying for salvation laying ’round in a one-room country shack

Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed
’Til there’s nothing left to see, ’til the chains have been shattered
And I’ve been freed

But I've been looking at my shadow, I been watching the colors up above
Looking at my shadow, watching the colors up above
Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love


Gon' walk on down that dirt road 'til everything becomes the same
Gon' walk down that dirt road 'til everything becomes the same
Well, I keep on walking 'til I hear her holler out my nameEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Eating grass on a mountainside so steep

Is Your Love in Vain?,"Do you love me, or are you just extending goodwill?
Do you need me half as bad as you say, or are you just feeling guilt?
I’ve been burned before and I know the score
So you won’t hear me complain
Will I be able to count on you
Or is your love in vain?

Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind
Or must I explain?
Will you let me be myself
Or is your love in vain?

Well I’ve been to the mountain and I’ve been in the wind
I’ve been in and out of happiness
I have dined with kings, I’ve been offered wings
And I’ve never been too impressed

All right, I’ll take a chance, I will fall in love with you
If I’m a fool you can have the night, you can have the morning too
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow
Do you understand my pain?
Are you willing to risk it all
Or is your love in vain?
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow
Do you understand my pain?
Are you willing to risk it all
Or is your love in vain?1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Dirge,"I hate myself for loving’ you and the weakness that it showed
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel
I hate myself for loving’ you and I’m glad the curtain fell

I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
And the mercy that you showed to me, who ever would have guessed?
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin

Heard your songs of freedom and man forever stripped
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped
Like a slave in orbit, he’s beaten ’till he’s tame
All for a moment’s glory and it’s a dirty, rotten shame

There are those who worship loneliness, I’m not one of them
In this age of fiberglass I’m searching for a gem
The crystal ball up on the wall hasn’t shown me nothing yet
I’ve paid the price of solitude, but at least I’m out of debt

Can’t recall a useful thing you ever did for me
’Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knees
We stared into each other’s eyes ’till one of us would break
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
So sing your praise of progress and of the Doom Machine
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I’m at
I hate myself for loving’ you, but I should get over that1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Someday Baby,"I don't care what you do, I don't care what you say
I don't care where you go or how long you stay
Someday baby, you are not going to worry po' me any more

Well you take my money and you turn me out
You fill me up with nothing but self doubt
Someday baby, you are not going to worry po' me anymore

When I was young, driving was my crave
You drive me so hard, almost to the grave
Someday baby, you are not going to worry po' me anymore

I'm so hard pressed, my mind tied up in knots
I keep recycling the same old thoughts
Someday baby you are not going to worry Po' me anymore

So many good things in life that I overlooked
I don't know what to do now, you got me so hooked
Someday baby you are not going to worry po' me any more

Well, I don't want to brag, but I'm going to ring your neck
When all else fails I'll make it a matter of self-respect
Someday baby, you are not going to worry Po' me any more
You can take your clothes put em in a sack
You gain' down the road, baby and you can't come back
Someday baby you are not going to worry po' me any more

I try to be friendly, I try to be kind
Now I'm gonna drive you from your home, just like I was driven from mine
Someday baby you are not going to worry po' me any more

Living this way is not a natural thing to do
Why was I born to love you?
Someday baby, you are not going to worry po' me any moreEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
I Guess I’ll Have to Change My Plans,"I guess I'll have to change my plan
I should have realized there'd be another man
I overlooked that point completely
Until the big affair began
Before I knew where I was at
I found myself upon the shelf and that was that
I tried to reach the moon but when I got there
All that I could get was the air
My feet are back upon the ground
I lost the one girl I'd found
Before I knew where I was at
I found myself upon the shelf and that was that
I tried to reach the moon but when I got there
All that I could get was the air
My feet are back upon the ground
I lost the one girl
The one girl I'd found
My boiling point is much too low
For me to try to be a fly LotharioEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Man of Peace,"Look out your window, baby, there’s a scene you’d like to catch
The band is playing “Dixie,” a man got his hand outstretched
Could be the Führer
Could be the local priest
You know sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace

He got a sweet gift of gab, he got a harmonious tongue
He knows every song of love that ever has been sung
Good intentions can be evil
Both hands can be full of grease
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace

Well, first he’s in the background, then he’s in the front
Both eyes are looking like they’re on a rabbit hunt
Nobody can see through him
No, not even the Chief of Police
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace

Well, he catch you when you’re hoping for a glimpse of the sun
Catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton
He could be standing next to you
The person that you’d notice least
I hear that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace
Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull
He can ride down Niagara Falls in the barrels of your skull
I can smell something cooking
I can tell there’s going to be a feast
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace

He’s a great humanitarian, he’s a great philanthropist
He knows just where to touch you, honey, and how you like to be kissed
He’ll put both his arms around you
You can feel the tender touch of the beast
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace

Well, the howling wolf will howl tonight, the king snake will crawl
Trees that’ve stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall
Want to get married? Do it now
Tomorrow all activity will cease
You know that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace

Somewhere Mama’s weeping for her blue-eyed boy
She’s holding them little white shoes and that little broken toy
And he’s following a star
The same one them three men followed from the East
I hear that sometimes Satan comes as a man of peaceEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
’Cross the Green Mountain,"I cross the green mountain, I slept by the stream
Heaven blazin' in my head, I dreamt a monstrous dream
Somethin' came up out of the sea
Swept through the land of the rich and the free
I look into the eyes of my merciful friend
And then I ask myself, is this the end?
Memories linger, sad yet sweet
And I think of the souls in heaven who will meet
Altars are burnin' with flames far and wide
The foe has crossed over from the other side
They tip their caps from the top of the hill
You can feel them come, more brave blood to spill
Along the dim Atlantic line
The ravaged land lies for miles behind
The light's comin' forward and the streets are broad
All must yield to the avengin' God
The world is old, the world is gray
Lessons of life can't be learned in a day
I watch and I wait and I listen while I stand
To the music that comes from a far better land
Close the eyes of our captain, peace may he know
His long night is done, the great leader is laid low
He was ready to fall, he was quick to defend
Killed outright he was, by his own men
It's the last day's last hour of the last happy year
I feel that the unknown world is so near
Pride will vanish and glory will rot
But virtue lives and cannot be forgot
The bells of the evening have rung
There's blasphemy on every tongue
Let 'em say that I walked in fair nature's light
And that I was loyal to truth and to right
Serve God and be cheerful, look upward, beyond
Beyond the darkness of masks, the surprises of dawn
In the deep green grasses of the blood stained wood
They never dreamed of surrenderin', they fell where they stood
Stars fell over Alabama, I saw each star
You're walkin' in dreams, whoever you are
Chilled are the skies, keen is the frost
The grounds froze hard and the morning is lost
A letter to mother came today
Gun shot wound to the breast is what it did say
But he'll be better soon, he's in a hospital bed
But he'll never be better, he's already dead
I'm ten miles outside the city and I'm lifted away
In an ancient light that is not of day
They were calm, they were blunt, we knew 'em all too well
We loved each other more than we ever dared to tellEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Don’t Fall Apart on Me Tonight,"Just a minute 'fore you leave, girl
Just a minute 'fore you touch the door
What is it that you’re trying to achieve, girl?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
Who’ve lost all ray of hope
You know, it's not even safe no more
In the palace of the Pope
Don’t fall apart on me tonight
I just don’t think that I could handle it
Don’t fall apart on me tonight
Yesterday’s just a memory
Tomorrow is never what it’s supposed to be
And I need you, yeah

Come over here from over there, girl
Sit down here, you can have my chair
I can’t see us goin' anywhere, girl
The only place open is a thousand miles away
And I can’t take you there
I wished I’d have been a doctor
Maybe I’d have saved some life that've been lost
Maybe I’d have done some good in the world
Instead of burning every bridge I crossed
Don’t fall apart on me tonight
I just don’t think that I could handle it
Don’t fall apart on me tonight
Yesterday’s just a memory
Tomorrow's never what it’s supposed to be
And I need you, ah, yeah

I ain't too good at conversation, girl
So you might not know exactly how I feel
But if I could I’d bring you to the mountain top, girl
And build you a house made out of stainless steel
But it’s like I’m stuck inside a painting
That’s a-hanging in the Louvre
My throat starts to tickle and my nose itches
But I know that I can’t move

Don’t fall apart on me tonight
I just don’t think that I could handle it
Don’t fall apart on me tonight
Yesterday’s gone but the past live' on
Tomorrow's just one step beyond
And I need you, ah
Who are these people that are walking towards you?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
With their humorless smiles so easy to see through
Can they tell you what’s wrong from what’s right?
Oh, do you remember St. James Street
Where you blew Jackie P.’s mind?
You were so fine, Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
And laid his life on the line
Let’s try to get beneath the surface waste, girl
No more booby traps and bombs
No more decadence and charms
No more affection that’s misplaced, girl
No more mudcake creatures lying in your arms
What about that millionaire
With the drumsticks in his pants?
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
When he played and we didn’t dance

Don’t fall apart on me tonight
I just don’t think that I could handle it
Don’t fall apart on me tonight
Yesterday is just a memory
Tomorrow's never what it’s supposed to be
And I need you
Yeah, you, ah
I need youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Paths of Victory,"Trails of troubles
Roads of battles
Paths of victory
I shall walk

The trail is dusty
And my road it might be rough
But the better roads are waiting
And boys it ain’t far off


I walked down by the river
I turned my head up high
I saw that silver linin’
That was hanging in the sky


The evening dusk was rolling
I was walking down the track
There was a one-way wind a-blowin’
And it was blowin’ at my back

The gravel road is bumpy
It’s a hard road to ride
But there’s a clearer road a-waitin’
With the cinders on the side


That evening train was rolling
The humming of its wheels
My eyes they saw a better day
As I looked across the fields


The trail is dusty
The road it might be rough
But the good road is a-waiting
And boys it ain’t far off

No Time to Think,"In death, you face life with a child and a wife
Who sleep-walks through your dreams into walls
You’re a soldier of mercy, you’re cold and you curse
“He who cannot be trusted must fall”

Loneliness, tenderness, high society, notoriety
You fight for the throne and you travel alone
Unknown as you slowly sink
And there’s no time to think

In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity
In secret, for pieces of change
The empress attracts you but oppression distracts you
And it makes you feel violent and strange

Memory, ecstasy, tyranny, hypocrisy
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss
In the valley of the missing link
And you have no time to think

Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you
Her worst is better than best
I’ve seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes
And I feel so depressed
China doll, alcohol, duality, mortality
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you
Like the plague, with a dangerous wink
And there’s no time to think

Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you
Where the lion lies down with the lamb
I’d have paid off the traitor and killed him much later
But that’s just the way that I am

Paradise, sacrifice, mortality, reality
But the magician is quicker and his game
Is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
And there’s no time to think

Anger and jealousy’s all that he sells us
He’s content when you’re under his thumb
Madmen oppose him, but your kindness throws him
To survive it you play deaf and dumb

Equality, liberty, humility, simplicity
You glance through the mirror and there’s eyes staring clear
At the back of your head as you drink
And there’s no time to think
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow
Will offer their heads for a prayer
You can’t find no salvation, you have no expectations
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere

Mercury, gravity, nobility, humility
You know you can’t keep her and the water gets deeper
That is leading you onto the brink
But there’s no time to think

You’ve murdered your vanity, buried your sanity
For pleasure you must now resist
Lovers obey you but they cannot sway you
They’re not even sure you exist

Socialism, hypnotism, patriotism, materialism
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws
And the sound of the keys as they clink
But there’s no time to think

The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl
With the rose in her hair
Starlight in the East and you’re finally released
You’re stranded but with nothing to share
Loyalty, unity, epitome, rigidity
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille
’Neath the moon shining’ bloody and pink
And there’s no time to think

Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you
But no, you will not be deceived
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt
You can give but you cannot receive

No time to choose when the truth must die
No time to lose or say goodbye
No time to prepare for the victim that’s there
No time to suffer or blink
And no time to thinkEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Hallelujah,"They say there was a secret chord

The minor fall, the major lifts
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

You saw her bathing on the roof
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your faith, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the

Well you say I took the name in vain
I didn't even know the name

It doesn't matter what you heard
The broken or the holy Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Billy 1,"There’s guns across the river aimin’ at ya
Lawman on your trail, he’d like to catch ya
Bounty hunters, too, they’d like to get ya
Billy, they don’t like you to be so free

Campaign’ out all night on the veranda
Dealing’ cards ’till dawn in the hacienda
Up to Boot Hill they’d like to send ya
Billy, don’t you turn your back on me

Playing’ around with some sweet señorita
Into her dark hallway she will lead ya
In some lonesome shadows she will greet ya
Billy, you’re so far away from home

There’s eyes behind the mirrors in empty places
Bullet holes and scars between the spaces
There’s always one more notch and ten more paces
Billy, and you’re walking’ all alone

They say that Pat Garrett’s got your number
So sleep with one eye open when you slumber
Every little sound just might be thunder
Thunder from the barrel of his gun
Guitars will play your grand finale
Down in some Tularosa alley
Maybe in the Rio Pecos valley
Billy, you’re so far away from home

There’s always some new stranger sneakin’ glances
Some trigger-happy fool willin’ to take chances
And some old whore from San Pedro to make advances
Advances on your spirit and your soul

The businessmen from Taos want you to go down
They’ve hired Pat Garrett to force a showdown
Billy, don’t it make ya feel so low-down
To be shot down by the man who was your friend?

Hang on to your woman if you got one
Remember in El Paso, once, you shot one
She may have been a whore, but she was a hot one

Union Sundown,"Well, my shoes, they come from Singapore
My flashlight’s from Taiwan
My tablecloth’s from Malaysia
My belt buckle’s from the Amazon
You know, this shirt I wear comes from the Philippines
And the car I drive is a Chevrolet
It was put together down in Argentina
By a guy making thirty cents a day

Well, it’s sundown on the union
And what’s made in the U.S.A
Sure was a good idea
'Til greed got in the way

Well, this silk dress is from Hong Kong
And the pearls are from Japan
Well, the dog collar’s from India
And the flower pot’s from Pakistan
All the furniture, it says “Made in Brazil”
Where a woman, she slaved for sure
Bringing home thirty cents a day to a family of twelve
You know, that’s a lot of money to her
Well, it’s sundown on the union
And what’s made in the U.S.A
Sure was a good idea
'Til greed got in the way

Well, you know, lots of people complaining that there is no work
I say, “Why you say that for
When nothing you got is U. S. made?”
They don’t make nothin’ here no more
You know, capitalism is above the law
It say, “It don’t count ’less it sells”
When it costs too much to build it at home
You just build it cheaper someplace else

Well, it’s sundown on the union
And what’s made in the U.S.A
Sure was a good idea
'Til greed got in the way

Well, the job that you used to have
They gave it to somebody down in El Salvador
The unions are big business, friend
And they’re going out like a dinosaur
They used to grow food in Kansas
Now they want to grow it on the moon and eat it raw
I can see the day coming when even your home garden
Is going to be against the law
Well, it’s sundown on the union
And what’s made in the U.S.A
Sure was a good idea
'Til greed got in the way

Democracy don’t rule the world
You’d better get that in your head
This world is ruled by violence
But I guess that’s better left unsaid
From Broadway to the Milky Way
That’s a lot of territory indeed
And a man’s going to do what he has to do
When he’s got a hungry mouth to feed

Well, it’s sundown on the union
And what’s made in the U.S.A
Sure was a good idea
'Til greed got in the wayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Born in Time,"In the lonely night
In the blinking stardust of a pale blue light
You’re coming’ thru to me in black and white
When we were made of dreams

You’re blowing down the shaky street
You’re hearing my heart beat
In the record-breaking heat
Where we were born in time

Not one more night, not one more kiss
Not this time baby, no more of this
Takes too much skill, takes too much will
It’s revealing

You came, you saw, just like the law
You married young, just like your ma
You tried and tried, you made me slide
You left me reeling with this feeling

On the rising curve
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve
You won’t get anything you don’t deserve
Where we were born in time
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice
You hang the flame, you’ll pay the price
Oh babe, that fire

Is still smoking
You were snow, you were rain
You were striped, you were plain
Oh babe, truer words
Have not been spoken or broken

In the hills of mystery
In the foggy web of destiny
You can have what’s left of me
Where we were born in timeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Death Is Not the End,"When you’re sad and when you’re lonely
And you haven’t got a friend
Just remember that death is not the end
And all that you’ve held sacred
Falls down and does not mend
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end

When you’re standing at the crossroads
That you cannot comprehend
Just remember that death is not the end
And all your dreams have vanished
And you don’t know what’s up the bend
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end

When the storm clouds gather ’round you
And heavy rains descend
Just remember that death is not the end
And there’s no one there to comfort you
With a helping hand to lend
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end
Oh, the tree of life is growing
Where the spirit never dies
And the bright light of salvation shines
In dark and empty skies

When the cities are on fire
With the burning flesh of men
Just remember that death is not the end
And you search in vain to find
Just one law-abiding citizen
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the endEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
He’s Funny That Way,"Once he dressed in silks and lace
And owned a Rolls Royce car
Now he seems quite out of place
Like a fallen star
Race around my kitchen sink
Happy as can be
I'll just have to stop and think
Why he fell for me

I'm not much to look at
Nothing to see
Just glad I'm living
And lucky to be
I've got a man crazy for me
He's funny that way
I can't save a dollar
Ain't worth a cent
He'd never hollar
He'd live in a tent
I've got a man crazy for me
He's funny that way
Though he'd love to work
And slave for me everyday
He'd be so much better off
If I went away

But why should I leave him?
Why should I go?
He'd be unhappy without me, I know
I've got a man crazy for me
He's funny that way

I can see no other way
And no better plan
Than to end it all and let him go
To some other man
When I hurt his feelings once in a while
His only answer is one little smile
I got a man crazy for me
He's funny that wayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Lonesome Day Blues,"Well, today has been a sad ol' lonesome day

With my mind a million miles away

Well, they're doing the double shuffle, throwing sand on the floor

She was standing in the door

Well, my Pa he died and left me, my brother got killed in the war

I never slept with her even once

Well, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast
Yeah, the road's washed out, weather not fit for man or beast
Funny, how the things you have the hardest time parting with
Are the things you need the least
Well, I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive
I'm forty miles from the mill, I'm dropping it into overdrive
Setting my dial on the radio
I wish my mother was still alive

I seen your loverman coming, coming across the barren field
I see your loverman coming, coming 'cross the barren field
He not a gentleman at all, he rotten to the core
He's a coward and he steals

Well, my Captain, he's decorated, he's well schooled and he's skilled

I'm gonna teach peace to the conquered
I'm gonna tame the proud

Beyond the Horizon,"Beyond the horizon, behind the sun
At the end of the rainbow life has only begun
In the long hours of twilight 'neath the stardust above
Beyond the horizon it is easy to love

My wretched heart's pounding
I felt an angel's kiss
My memories are drowning
In mortal bliss
Beyond the horizon, in the Springtime or Fall
Love waits forever for one and for all

Beyond the horizon across the divide
'Round about midnight, we'll be on the same side
Down in the valley the water runs cold
Beyond the horizon someone prayed for your soul

I'm touched with desire
What don't I do?
I'll throw the logs on the fire
I'll build my world around you
Beyond the horizon, at the end of the game
Every step that you take, I'm walking the same

Beyond the horizon the night winds blow
The theme of a melody from many moons ago
The bells of St. Mary, how sweetly they chime
Beyond the horizon I found you just in time

It's dark and it's dreary
I ponder in vain
I'm weakened, I'm weary
My repentance is plain
Beyond the horizon o'er the treacherous sea
I still can't believe that you've set aside your love for me

Beyond the horizon, 'neath crimson skies
In the soft light of morning I'll follow you with my eyes
Through countries and kingdoms and temples of stone
Beyond the horizon right down to the bone

It's late in the season
Never knew, never cared
Whatever the reason
Someone's life has been spared
Beyond the horizon the sky is so blue
I've got more than a lifetime to live lovin' youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
"If You Gotta Go, Go Now","Listen to me, baby
There’s something you must see
I want to be with you, gal
If you want to be with me

But if you got to go
It’s all right
But if you got to go, go now
Or else you got to stay all night

It am not that I’m questioning you
To take part in any quiz
It’s just that I have got no watch
And you keep asking me what time it is


I am just a poor boy, baby
Looking to connect
But I certainly don’t want you thinking
That I have not got any respect

You know I’d have nightmares
And a guilty conscience, too
If I kept you from anything
That you really wanted to do


It ain't that I’m wanting
Anything you never gave before
It’s just that I’ll be sleeping soon
It’ll be too dark for you to find the door

I Am a Lonesome Hobo,"I am a lonesome hobo
Without family or friends
Where another man’s life might begin
That’s exactly where mine ends
I have tried my hand at bribery
Blackmail and deceit
And I’ve served time for everything
’Cept beggin' on the street

Well, once I was rather prosperous
There was nothing I did lack
I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth
And silk upon my back
But I did not trust my brother
I carried him to blame
Which led me to my fatal doom
To wander off in shame

Kind ladies and kind gentlemen
Soon I will be gone
But let me just warn you all
Before I do pass on
Stay free from petty jealousies
Live by no man’s code
And hold your judgment for yourself
Lest you wind up on this roadEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
On a Rainy Afternoon,"Now she's walkin' in the morning
Howlin' you come home
I'll be on my way, so long, forlorn

If I haunt you back all day
Carry my trouble
Yes you satisfy my mind
I'll try to tell you, if I can't come in
And I must stay true
I'll be happy in the morning
I try my best, I will try to help you
If I can, and I leave it too

Won't some time away

Try my best, but if I fail
You must help me to see you
As I go by...
Dylan: No, it's twice as slow. Twice as slow. It's too fast
Yeah, but it can go in there, man, but it's just gonna be twice as slow as that
I'll fit the words in, same words, but it's gonna be twice as slow. Play every chord about twice as slow
Dylan: OK. let's try it again
Now, if you send me a letter
I'll be on my way to get it for you
I'll be with my sister too
I can't find me what to do
Yes, I've been trying to get a message
To you, but you have to treat me

That he’s tall, dark and handsome, and you’re holdin' his hand

Sugar Baby,"I got my back to the sun ’cause the light is too intense
I can see what everybody in the world is up against
You can’t turn back, you can’t come back, sometimes we push too far
One day you’ll open up your eyes and you’ll see where we are

Sugar Baby get on down the road
You ain’t got no brains, no how
You went years without me
Might as well keep going now

Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff
Plenty of places to hide things here if you wanna hide ’em bad enough
I’m staying with Aunt Sally, but you know, she’s not really my aunt
Some of these memories you can learn to live with and some of them you can’t

Sugar Baby get on down the line
You ain’t got no brains, no how
You went years without me
You might as well keep going now

The ladies down in Darktown, they’re doing the Darktown Strut
You always got to be prepared but you never know for what
There ain’t no limit to the amount of trouble women bring
Love is pleasing, love is teasing, love’s not an evil thing
Sugar Baby, get on down the road
You ain’t got no brains, no how
You went years without me
You might as well keep going now

Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick
Happiness can come suddenly and leave just as quick
Any minute of the day the bubble could burst
Try to make things better for someone, sometimes, you just end up making it a thousand times worse

Sugar Baby, get on down the road
You ain’t got no brains, no how
You went years without me
Might as well keep going now

Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one
You got a way of tearing the world apart. Love, see what you done
Just as sure as we’re living, just as sure as you’re born
Look up, look up, seek your Maker,’fore Gabriel blows his horn

Sugar Baby, get on down the line
You ain’t got no sense, no how
You went years without me
Might as well keep going now1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
On a Night Like This,"On a night like this
So glad you came around
Hold on to me so tight
And heat up some coffee grounds
We got much to talk about
And much to reminisce
It sure is right
On a night like this

On a night like this
So glad you’ve come to stay
Hold on to me, pretty miss
Say you’ll never go away to stray
Run your fingers down my spine
Bring me a touch of bliss
It sure feels right
On a night like this

On a night like this
I can’t get any sleep
The air is so cold outside
And the snow’s so deep
Build a fire, throw on logs
And listen to it hiss
And let it burn, burn, burn, burn
On a night like this
Put your body next to mine
And keep me company
There is plenty a-room for all
So please don’t elbow me

Let the four winds blow
Around this old cabin door
If I’m not too far off
I think we did this once before
There’s more frost on the window glass
With each new tender kiss
But it sure feels right
On a night like thisEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Po’ Boy,"Man comes to the door, I say, “For whom are you looking?”
He says, “Your wife,” I say, “She’s busy in the kitchen cooking”
Poor boy, where you been?
I already told you, won’t tell you again

I say, “How much you want for that?” I go into the store
The man says, “Three dollars.” “All right,” I say, “Will you take four?”
Poor boy, never say die
Things will be all right by and by

Been working on the mainline, working like the devil
The game is the same, it’s just up on a different level
Poor boy, dressed in black
Police at your back

Poor boy in a red hot town
Out beyond the twinkling stars
Riding first-class trains, making the rounds
Trying to keep from falling between the cars

Othello told Desdemona, “I’m cold, cover me with a blanket
By the way, what happened to that poison wine?”
She said, “I gave it to you, you drank it”
Poor boy, laying them straight, picking up the cherries falling off the plate
Time and love has branded me with its claws
Had to go to Florida, dodging them Georgia laws
Poor boy, in the hotel called the Palace of Gloom
Calls down to room service, says send up a room

My mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer
My father was a traveling salesman, I never met him
When my mother died, my uncle took me in, he run a funeral parlor
He did a lot of nice things for me and I won’t forget him

All I know is that I’m thrilled by your kiss
I don’t know any more than this
Poor boy, picking up sticks
Build you a house out of mortar and bricks

Knocking on the door, I say, “Who is it and where are you from?”
Man says, “Freddy!” I say, “Freddy who?” He says, “Freddy or not here I come”
Poor boy beneath the stars that shine
Washing them dishes, feeding them swine1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
What Was It You Wanted,"What was it you wanted?
Tell me again so I’ll know
What’s happening in there
What’s going on in your show
What was it you wanted
Could you say it again?
I’ll be back in a minute
You can get it together by then

What was it you wanted
You can tell me, I’m back
We can start it all over
Get it back on the track
You got my attention
Go ahead, speak
What was it you wanted
When you were kissing my cheek?

Was there somebody looking
When you give me that kiss
Someone there in the shadows
Someone that I might have missed?
Is there something you needed
Something I don’t understand
What was it you wanted
Do I have it here in my hand?
Whatever you wanted
Slipped out of my mind
Would you remind me again
If you’d be so kind
Has the record been breaking
Did the needle just skip
Is there somebody waiting
Was there a slip of the lip?

What was it you wanted
I ain’t keeping score
Are you the same person
That was here before?
Is it something important?
Maybe not
What was it you wanted?
Tell me again I forgot

Whatever you wanted
What could it be
Did somebody tell you
That you could get it from me
Is it something that comes natural
Is it easy to say
Why do you want it
Who are you anyway?
Is the scenery changing
Am I getting it wrong
Is the whole thing going backwards
Are they playing our song?
Where were you when it started
Do you want it for free
What was it you wanted
Are you talking to me?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
When You Gonna Wake Up,"God don’t make no promises that He don’t keep
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep

When you are going to wake up, when you going to wake up
When you are going to wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts
Karl Marx has got ya by the throat and Henry Kissinger’s got you tied up in knots

When you are going to wake up, when you going to wake up
When you are going to wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled
You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that’ll never cure your ills

When you are going to wake up, when you going to wake up
When you are going to wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

You got men who can’t hold their peace and women who can’t control their tongues
The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young
When you are going to wake up, when you going to wake up
When you are going to wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules

When you are going to wake up, when you going to wake up
When you are going to wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move
Instant inner peace and every step you take has got to be approved

When you are going to wake up, when you going to wake up
When you are going to wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
You think He’s just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires

When you are going to wake up, when you going to wake up
When you are going to wake up and strengthen the things that remain?
You can’t take it with you and you know that it’s too worthless to be sold
They tell you, “Time is money,” as if your life was worth its weight in gold

When you are going to wake up, when you going to wake up
When you are going to wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

There’s a Man up on a cross and He’s been crucified for you
Beleive in  His power, it's all about you got to do

When you are going to wake up and strengthen the things that remain?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Soft as music, light as spring
It was a girl I learned it from
Living down Sonora way
Well, I don't look much like a lover
Still I say her love words over
Mostly when I'm all alone
Mi amor, mi Cora sole

Haven't seen her since that night
I can't cross the line you know
They want me for a gambling fight
Like as not it's better so
Still I always kind of missed her

Floater (Too Much to Ask),"Down over the window
Comes the dazzling sunlit rays
Through the back alleys—through the blinds
Another one of them endless days

Honey bees are buzzing
Leaves begin to stir
I’m in love with my second cousin
I tell myself I could be happy forever with her

I keep listening for footsteps
But I ain’t hearing any
From the boat I fish for bullheads
I catch a lot, sometimes too many

A summer breeze is blowing
A squall is settin’ in
Sometimes it’s just plain stupid
To get into any kind of wind

The old men ’round here, sometimes they get
On bad terms with the younger men
But old, young, age don’t carry weight
It doesn’t matter in the end
One of the boss’ hangers-on
Comes to call at times you least expect
Try to bully ya—strong-arm you—inspire you with fear
It has the opposite effect

There’s a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town
The old one is long gone
Timber two-foot-six across
Burns with the bark still on

They say times are hard, if you don’t believe it
You can just follow your nose
It don’t bother me—times are hard everywhere
We’ll just have to see how it goes

My old man, he’s like some feudal lord
Got more lives than a cat
Never seen him quarrel with my mother even once
Things come alive or they fall flat

You can smell the pinewood burning
You can hear the school bell ring
Gotta get up near the teacher if you can
If you wanna learn anything
Romeo, he said to Juliet, “You got a poor complexion
It doesn’t give your appearance a very youthful touch!”
Juliet said back to Romeo, “Why don’t you just shove off
If it bothers you so much”

They all got out of here any way they could
The cold rain can give you the shivers
They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee
All the rest of them rebel rivers

If you ever try to interfere with me or cross my path again
You do so at the peril of your own life
I’m not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound
I’ve seen enough heartaches and strife

My grandfather was a duck trapper
He could do it with just dragnets and ropes
My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth
I don’t know if they had any dreams or hopes

I had them once though, I suppose, to go along
With all the ring-dancing Christmas carols on all of the Christmas eves
I left all my dreams and hopes
Buried under tobacco leaves
It’s not always easy kicking someone out
Gotta wait a while—it can be an unpleasant task
Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up
And tears or not, it’s too much to askEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Where Are You Tonight? (Journey Through Dark Heat),"There’s a long-distance train rolling through the rain
Tears on the letter I write
There’s a woman I long to touch and I miss her so much
But she’s drifting like a satellite

There’s a neon light ablaze in a green smoky haze
Laughter down on Elizabeth Street
And a lonesome bell tone in that valley of stone
Where she bathed in a stream of pure heat

Her father would emphasize you got to be more than streetwise
But he practiced what he preached from the heart
A full-blooded Cherokee, he predicted it to me
The time and the place that we'd part

There’s a babe in the arms of a woman in a rage
And a longtime golden-haired stripper onstage
And she winds back the clock and she turns back the page
Of a book that nobody can write
Oh, where are you tonight?

The truth was obscure, too profound and too pure
To live it you had to explode
In that last hour of need, we entirely agreed
Sacrifice was the code of the road
I left town at dawn, with Marcel and St. John
Strong men belittled by doubt
I couldn’t tell her what my private thoughts were
But she had some way of finding them out

He took dead-center aim but he missed just the same
She was waiting, putting flowers on the shelf
She could feel my despair as I climbed up her hair
And discovered her invisible self

There’s a lion in the road, there’s a demon escaped
There’s a million dreams gone, there’s a landscape being raped
As her beauty fades and I watch her undrape
I won’t but then again, maybe I might
Oh, if I could just find you tonight

I fought with my twin, that enemy within
’Til both of us fell by the way
Horseplay and disease is killing me by degrees
While the law looks the other way

Your partners in crime hit me up for nickels and dimes
The man you were lovin’ could never get clean
It felt out of place, my foot in his face
But he should-a stayed where his money was green
I bit into the root of forbidden fruit
With the juice running down my leg
Then I dealt with your boss, who’d never known about loss
Who always was too proud to beg

There’s a white diamond gloom on the dark side of this room
And a pathway that leads up to the stars
If you don’t believe there’s a price for this sweet paradise
Just remind me to show you the scars

There’s a new day at dawn and I’ve finally arrived
If I’m there in the morning, baby, you’ll know I’ve survived
I can’t believe it, I can’t believe I’m alive
But without you it just doesn’t seem right
Oh, where are you tonight?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Seven Curses,"Old Reilly stole a stallion
But they caught him and they brought him back
And they laid him down on the Jailhouse ground
With an iron chain around his neck

Old Reilly’s daughter got a message
That her father was going’ to hang
She rode by night and came by morning
With gold and silver in her hand

When the judge he saw Reilly’s daughter
His old eyes deepened in his head
Saying, “Gold will never free your father
The price, my dear, is you instead”

“Oh I’m as good as dead,” cried Reilly
“It’s only you that he does crave
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all
Get on your horse and ride away”

“Oh father you will surely die
If I don’t take the chance to try
And pay the price and not take your advice
For that reason I will have to stay”
The gallows shadows shook the evening
In the night a hound dog bayed
In the night the grounds were groaning
In the night the price was paid

The next morning she had awoken
To know that the judge had never spoken
She saw that hangin’ branch a-bendin’
She saw her father’s body broken

These be seven curses on a judge so cruel:
That one doctor will not save him
That two healers will not heal him
That three eyes will not see him

That four ears will not hear him
That five walls will not hide him
That six diggers will not bury him
And that seven deaths shall never kill him1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Mr. Bojangles,"I knew a man Bojangles and he'd dance for you in worn out shoes
Silver hair, ragged shirt and baggy pants, that old soft shoe
He'd jump so high, he'd jump so high, then he lightly touch down?
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance
I met him in a cell in New Orleans, I was down and out
He looked to me to be the eyes of age as he spoke right out
He talked of life, he talked of life, laughing slapped his leg stale
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance
He said the name Bojangles and he danced a lick all across the cell
He grabbed his pants for a better stance
Oh, he jumped so high and he clicked up his heels
He let go laugh, he let go laugh, shook back his clothes all around
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance, yeah, dance
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs
Throughout the south
He spoke with tears of 15 years of how his dog and him
Just traveled about
But his dog up and died, he up and died
And after 20 years he still grieves
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, dance
He said, ""I dance now at every chance at honky-tonks
For drinks and tips
But most of the time I spend behind these county bars
Because I drinks a bit""
He shook his head, yes, he shook his head
I heard someone ask him, ""Please ...

Who Killed Davey Moore?,"Who killed Davey Moore?

“Not I,” says the referee

There’s just as much danger in a football game”
Saying, “Fist fighting is here to stay
It’s just the old American way
It wasn’t me that made him fall
No, you can’t blame me at all”

Who killed Davey Moore?
Why, and what’s the reason for?

“Not me,” says the man whose fists
Laid him low in a cloud of mist
Who came here from Cuba’s door
Where boxing is not allowed no more
“I hit him, yes, it’s true
But that’s what I am paid to do
Don’t say ‘murder,’ don’t say ‘kill’
It was destiny, it was God’s will”
Who killed Davey Moore?
Why, and what’s the reason for?1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Seven Days,"Seven days, seven more days she’ll be coming
I’ll be waiting at the station for her to arrive
Seven more days, all I gotta do is survive

She been gone ever since I been a child
Ever since I seen her smile, I ain’t forgotten her eyes
She had a face that could outshine the sun in the skies
I been good, I been good while I been waiting
Maybe guilty of hesitating, I just been holding on
Seven more days, all that’ll be gone

There’s kissing in the valley
Thieving in the alley
Fighting every inch of the way
Trying to be tender
With somebody I remember
In a night that’s always brighter’n the day

Seven days, seven more days that are connected
Just like I expected, she’ll be coming on forth
My beautiful comrade from the north

When He Returns,"The iron hand, it ain't match for the iron rod
The strongest wall will crumble and fall to a mighty God
For all those who have eyes and all those who have ears
It is only He who can reduce me to tears
Don’t you cry and don’t you die and don’t you burn
For like a thief in the night, He’ll replace wrong with right
When He returns

Truth is an arrow and the gate is narrow that it passes through
He unleashed His power at an unknown hour that no one knew
How long can I listen to the lies of prejudice?
How long can I stay drunk on fear out in the wilderness?
Can I cast it aside, all this loyalty and this pride?
Will I ever learn that there’ll be no peace, that the war won’t cease
Until He returns?

Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take off your mask
He sees your deeds, He knows your needs even before you ask
How long can you falsify and deny what is real?
How long can you hate yourself for the weakness you conceal?
Of every earthly plan that be known to man, He is unconcerned
He’s got plans of His own to set up His throne
When He returnsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Main Title Theme (Billy),
Beyond Here Lies Nothin’,"Oh, well, I love ya pretty baby
You're the only love I've ever known
Just as long as you stay with me
The whole world is my throne

Beyond here lies nothin
Nothin we can call our own

Well, I'm moving after midnight
Down boulevards of broken cars
Don't know what I'd do without it
Without this love that we call ours

Beyond here lies nothin
Nothin but the moon and stars

Down every street there's a window
And every window made of glass
We'll keep on loving, pretty baby
For as long as love will last
Beyond here lies nothin
But the mountains of the past

Well, my ship is in the harbor
And the sails are spread
Listen to me, pretty baby
Lay your hand upon my head

Beyond here lies nothin
Nothin done, and nothin said2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Rollin’ and Tumblin’,"I rolled and I tumbled, I cried the whole night long

Woke up this morning', I must have bet my money wrong

Some young lazy slut has charmed away my brains

The landscape is glowing', gleaming' in the golden light of day

Well, I did all I know just to keep you off my mind

I ain't nobody's house boy, I ain't nobody's well trained maid

I'm flat-out spent, this woman has been driving' me to tears
I'm flat-out spent, this woman she has been driving' me to tears
This woman so crazy, I swear I ain't gonna touch another one for years
Well, the warm weather is coming' and the buds are on the vine
The warm weather's comin', the buds are on the vine
Ain't nothing so depressing as trying to satisfy this woman of mine

I got up this morning', saw the rising sun return
Well, I got up this morning', seen the rising sun return
Sooner or later you too shall burn

The night's filled with shadows, the years are filled with early doom
The night's filled with shadows, the years are filled with early doom
I've been conjuring up all these long dead souls from their crumbling' tombs

Let's forgive each other darling', let's go down to the greenwood glen
Let's forgive each other darling', let's go down to the greenwood glen
Let's put our heads together, let's put old matters to an end

Now I rolled and I tumbled and I cried the whole night long
Ah, I rolled and I tumbled, I cried the whole night long
I woke up this morning, I think I must be traveling' wrongEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
The First Noel,"(Noel, noel, noel, noel)
(Noel, noel)

The first Noel, the angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night that was so deep
Noel Noel Noel Noel
Born is the King of Israel

They looked up and saw a star
Shining in the East beyond them far
And to the earth it gave great light
And so it continued both day and night
Noel Noel Noel Noel
Born is the King of Israel

This by the light of that same star
Three wise men came from country far
To seek for a King was their intent
And to follow the star wherever it went
Noel Noel Noel Noel
Born is the King of Israel
Ah NoelEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Went to See the Gypsy,"Went to see the gypsy
Staying in a big hotel
He smiled when he saw me coming
And he said, “Well, well, well”
His room was dark and crowded
Lights were low and dim
“How are you?” he said to me
I said it back to him

I went down to the lobby
To make a small call out
A pretty dancing girl was there
And she began to shout
“Go on back to see the gypsy
He can move you from the rear
Drive you from your fear
Bring you through the mirror
He did it in Las Vegas
And he can do it here”

Outside the lights were shining
On the river of tears
I watched them from the distance
With music in my ears
I went back to see the gypsy
It was nearly early dawn
The gypsy’s door was open wide
But the gypsy was gone
And that pretty dancing girl
She could not be found
So I watched that sun come rising
From that little Minnesota townEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Disease of Conceit,"There’s a whole lot of people suffering tonight
From the disease of conceit
Whole lot of people struggling tonight
From the disease of conceit
Comes right down the highway
Straight down the line
Rips into your senses
Through your body and your mind
Nothing about it that’s sweet
The disease of conceit

There’s a whole lot of hearts breaking tonight
From the disease of conceit
Whole lot of hearts shaking tonight
From the disease of conceit
Steps into your room
Eats your soul
Over your senses
You have no control
Ain’t nothing too discreet
About the disease of conceit

There’s a whole lot of people dying tonight
From the disease of conceit
Whole lot of people crying tonight
From the disease of conceit
Comes right out of nowhere
And you’re down for the count
From the outside world
The pressure will mount
Turn you into a piece of meat
The disease of conceit
Conceit is a disease
That the doctors got no cure
They’ve done a lot of research on it
But what it is, they’re still not sure

There’s a whole lot of people in trouble tonight
From the disease of conceit
Whole lot of people seeing double tonight
From the disease of conceit
Give ya delusions of grandeur
And a evil eye
Give you the idea that
You’re too good to die
Then they bury you from your head to your feet
From the disease of conceitEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
900 Miles from My Home,"But I'm down here on this track
Not a shirt upon my back
I will sell to you this island that I own
Yes I feed the mouths I took
But as down winds on the brook
Lord I'm 900 miles from my home
If my old lady she says so
I'll railroad no more
Sidetrack this engine but I still roam
Yes I've given in my call
I've gladly given it all
'Cause I'm 900 miles from my home
If I get down by the bank And the river still does run
Yes and everything I see turns to foam
Even down on the ocean side
No she don't wade in just to bang my pride
'Cause I'm 900 miles from my home
Oh Mary don't you moan
Don't you weep on the ground Oh Mary don't you weep and don't you moan
If I get myself in line
I will be there in due time

Honest with Me,"Well, I’m stranded in the city that never sleeps
Some of these women they just give me the creeps
I’m avoidin’ the Southside the best I can
These memories I got, they can strangle a man

Well I came ashore in the dead of the night
Lot of things can get in the way when you’re tryin’ to do what’s right
You don’t understand it—my feelings for you
You’d be honest with me if only you knew

I’m not sorry for nothin’ I’ve done
I’m glad I fought—I only wish we’d won
The Siamese twins are comin’ to town
People can’t wait—they’re gathered around

When I left my home the sky split open wide
I never wanted to go back there—I’d rather have died
You don’t understand it—my feelings for you
You’d be honest with me if only you knew

My woman got a face like a teddy bear
She’s tossin’ a baseball bat in the air
The meat is so tough you can’t cut it with a sword
I’m crashin’ my car, trunk first into the boards
You say my eyes are pretty and my smile is nice
Well, I’ll sell it to ya at a reduced price
You don’t understand it—my feelings for you
You’d be honest with me, if only you knew

Some things are too terrible to be true
I won’t come here no more if it bothers you
The Southern Pacific leaving me at nine forty-five
I’m having a hard time believin’ some people were ever alive

I’m stark naked, but I don’t care
I’m going off into the woods, I’m huntin’ bare
You don’t understand it—my feelings for you
Well, you’d be honest with me if only you knew

I’m here to create the new imperial empire
I’m going to do whatever circumstances require
I care so much for you—didn’t think that I could
I can’t tell my heart that you’re no good

Well, my parents they warned me not to waste my years
And I still got their advice oozing out of my ears
You don’t understand it—my feelings for you
Well, you’d be honest with me if only you knewEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
September of My Years,"One day you turn around and it's summer
Next day you turn around and it's fall
And the springs and the winters of a lifetime
Whatever happened to them all?
As a man who has always had the wand'ring ways
Now I'm reaching back for yesterdays
'Til a long-forgotten love appears
And I find that I'm sighing softly as I near
September, the warm September of my years
As I man who has never paused at wishing wells
Now I'm watching children's carousels
And their laughter's music to my ears
And I find that I'm smiling gently as I near
September, the warm September of my years
The golden warm September of my yearsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Where Teardrops Fall,"Far away where the soft winds blow
Far away from it all
There is a place you go
Where teardrops fall

Far away in the stormy night
Far away and over the wall
You are there in the flickering light
Where teardrops fall

We banged the drum slowly
And played the fife lowly
You know the song in my heart
In the turning of twilight
In the shadows of moonlight
You can show me a new place to start

I’ve torn my clothes and I’ve drained the cup
Stripping away at it all
Thinking of you when the sun comes up
Where teardrops fall
By rivers of blindness
In love and with kindness
We could hold up a toast if we meet
To the cutting of fences
To sharpen the senses
That linger in the fireball heat

Roses are red, violets are blue
And time is beginning to crawl
I just might have to come see you
Where teardrops fall1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Highway 51 Blues,"Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door
Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door
If I don't get the girl I'm loving
Won't go down to Highway 51 no more

Well, I know that highway like I know my hand
Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand
Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land
Well, if I should die before my time should come
And if I should die before my time should come
Won't you bury my body out on the Highway 51

Bye and Bye,"Bye and bye, I'm breathin' a lover's sigh
While I'm sittin' on my watch so I can be on time
I'm singin' love's praises with sugar-coated rhyme
Bye and bye, on you I'm casting my eye

I'm paintin' the town, swinging my partner around
Well, I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust
I'm watchin' the roads, I'm studying the dust
I'm paintin' the town
Making my last go-round

Well, I'm scufflin' and I'm shufflin' and I'm walkin' on briars
I'm not even acquainted with my own desires

I'm rollin' slow
I'm doing all I know
I'm tellin' myself I found true happiness
That I've still got a dream that hasn't been repossessed
I'm rollin' slow
Goin' where the wild roses grow

Well, the future for me is already a thing of the past
You were my first love and you will be my last
Papa gone mad
Mamma, she's feeling sad
Well, I'm gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more
I'm gonna establish my rule through civil war
Gon' make you see just how loyal and true a man can beEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Days of 49,"I'm old Tom Moore from the bummer's shore in that good old golden days
They call me a bummer and a ginsot too, but what cares I for praise ?
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
And all the people say, ""There goes Tom Moore, in the days of '49""

In the days of old, in the days of gold
How oft'times I repine for the days of old
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49

My comrades they all loved me well, a jolly saucy crew
A few hard cases I will recall though they all were brave and true
Whatever the pitch they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine
Like good old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49

In the days of old, in the days of gold
How oft'times I repine for the days of old
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49

There was New York Jake, the butcher boy, he was always getting tight
And every time that he'd get full he was spoiling for a fight
But Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49
In the days of old, in the days of gold
How oft'times I repine for the days of old
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49

There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same
He would ante up and draw his cards and he would you go a hatful blind
In the game with death Bill lost his breath, in the days of '49

In the days of old, in the days of gold
How oft'times I repine for the days of old
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49

There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo, I never will forget
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet
One day he fell in a prospect hole, in a roaring bad design
And in that hole he roared out his soul, in the days of '49

In the days of old, in the days of gold
How oft'times I repine for the days of old
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49
Of the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
And I'm left alone in my misery like some poor wandering ghost
And I pass by from town to town, they call me a rambling sign
""There goes Tom Moore, a bummer shore in the days of '49 ""

In the days of old, in the days of gold
How oft'times I repine for the days of old
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Pressing On,"Well I’m pressing on
Yes, I’m pressing on
Well I’m pressing on
To the higher calling of my Lord

Many try to stop me, shake me up in my mind
Say, “Prove to me that He is Lord, show me a sign”
What kind of sign they need when it all come from within
When what’s lost has been found, what’s to come has already been?


Shake the dust off of your feet, don’t look back
Nothing now can hold you down, nothing that you lack
Temptation’s not an easy thing, Adam given the devil reign
Because he sinned I got no choice, it run in my vein

By His strength I do endure
By His power I’ve been lifted
In His love I am secure
He bought me with a price
Freed me from the pit
Full of emptiness and wrath
And the fire that burns in it

Nobody to rescue me
Nobody would dare
I was going down for the last time
But by His mercy I’ve been spared
Not by works
But by faith in Him who called
For so long I’ve been hindered
For so long I’ve been stalled

The fair fields all alone
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron
Where beauty and pleasure were known

I spied a fair maid at her labour
Which caused me to stay for a while
And I thought of a goddess to beauty
Bloomin' bright star of Bright Isle

I humbled myself to her beauty
""Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Are you from heaven descended
Abiding in Cupid's fair throne?""

""Young man, I will tell you a secret
It's true I'm a maid that is poor
And to part from my vows and my promise
Is more than my heart can endure

Therefore I remain at my service
And go through all my hardship and toil
And wait for the lad that has left me
All alone on the banks of Belle Isle.""
""Young maiden I wish not to banter
It's true I come here in disguise
I came here to fulfill our last promise
And hope to give you a surprise

I've known you're a maid I love dearly
And you've been in my heart all the while
For me there is no other damsel
Than my blooming bright star of Belle Isle.""EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Moonlight,"The seasons they are turnin' and my sad heart is yearning
To hear again the songbird’s sweet melodious tone

The dusky light, the day is losing, Orchids, Poppies, Black-eyed Susan
The earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone
Won’t you meet me out in the moonlight alone?

The air is thick and heavy all along the levy
Where the geese into the countryside have flown
Won’t you meet me out in the moonlight alone?

Well, I’m preaching peace and harmony
The blessings of tranquility
Yet I know when the time is right to strike
I’ll take you cross the river dear
You’ve no need to linger here
I know the kinds of things you like

The clouds are turning crimson, the leaves fall from the limbs an’
The branches cast their shadows over stone
Won’t you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerades of birds and bees
The petals, pink and white, the wind has blown
Won’t you meet me out in the moonlight alone?

The trailing moss and mystic glow
The purple blossoms soft as snow
My tears keep flowing to the sea
Doctor, lawyer, Indian chief
It takes a thief to catch a thief
For whom does the bell toll for, love?
It tolls for you and me

My pulse is running through my palm, the sharp hills are rising from
The yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan
Won’t you meet me out in the moonlight alone?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Freight train was it taught me how to cry
The holler of the driver was my lullaby
I got the freight train blues
Oh Lord mama, I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes
And when the whistle blows I got to go baby, don't you know
Well, it looks like I'm never going to lose the freight train blues

Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama-ha
She was the only daughter of an engineer
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke
Seems a waste to get a good man broke

Oh Lord mama, I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes
And when the whistle blows I got to go mama, don't you know
Well, it looks like I'm never going to lose the freight train blues

Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train
Every place I want to go I never can go
Because you know I got the freight train blues

Something There Is About You,"Something there is about you that strikes a match in me
Is it the way your body moves or is it the way your hair blows free?
Or is it because you remind me of something that used to be
Something’ that crossed over from another century?

Thought I’d shaken the wonder and the phantoms of my youth
Rainy days on the Great Lakes, walk-in’ the hills of old Duluth
There was me and Danny Lopez, cold eyes, black night and then there was Ruth
Something there is about you that brings back a long-forgotten truth

Suddenly I found you and the spirit in me sings
Don’t have to look no further, you’re the soul of many things
I could say that I’d be faithful, I could say it in one sweet, easy breath
But to you that would be cruelty and to me it surely would be death

Something there is about you that moves with style and grace
I was in a whirlwind, now I’m in some better place
My hand’s on the sabre and you’ve picked up the baton
Something’ there is about you that I can’t quite put my finger onEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

She’s a flower of velvet and the rose of Celine

Her parents was against me
Now she is the same
If I write on your book, love
Just you blot out my name
Oh there’s changes in the ocean
There’s changes in the sea
There’s changes in my true love
There's no change in me1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Percy’s Song,"Bad news, bad news
Come to me where I sleep
Turn, turn, turn again
Sayin’ one of your friends
Is in trouble deep
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind
Tell me the trouble
Tell once to my ear
Turn, turn, turn again
Joliet prison
And ninety-nine years
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind

Oh what’s the charge
Of how this came to be
Turn, turn, turn again
Manslaughter
In the highest of degrees
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind
I sat down and wrote
The best words I could write
Turn, turn, turn again
Explaining to the judge
I’d be there on Wednesday night
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind
Without a reply
I left by the moon
Turn, turn, turn again
And was in his chambers
By the next afternoon
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind
Could ya tell me the facts?
I said without fear
Turn, turn, turn again
That a friend of mine
Would get ninety-nine years
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind

A crash on the highway
Flew the car to a field
Turn, turn, turn again
There was four persons killed
And he was at the wheel
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind
But I knew him as good
As I’m knowing myself
Turn, turn, turn again
And he wouldn’t harm a life
That belonged to someone else
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind
The judge spoke
Out of the side of his mouth
Turn, turn, turn again
Sayin’, “The witness who saw
He left little doubt”
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind
That may be true
He’s got a sentence to serve
Turn, turn, turn again
But ninety-nine years
He just don’t deserve
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind

Too late, too late
For his case it is sealed
Turn, turn, turn again
His sentence is passed
And it cannot be repealed
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind
But he ain’t no criminal
And his crime it is none
Turn, turn, turn again
What happened to him
Could happen to anyone
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind
And at that the judge jerked forward
And his face it did freeze
Turn, turn, turn again
Sayin’, “Could you kindly leave
My office now, please”
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind
Well his eyes looked funny
And I stood up so slow
Turn, turn, turn again
With no other choice
Except for to go
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind

I walked down the hallway
And I heard his door slam
Turn, turn, turn again
I walked down the courthouse stairs
And I did not understand
Turn, turn to the rain
And the wind
And I played my guitar
Through the night to the day
Turn, turn, turn again
And the only tune
My guitar could play
Was, “Oh the Cruel Rain
And the Wind”1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Time Passes Slowly,"Time passes slowly up here in the mountains
We sit beside bridges and walk beside fountains
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream
Time passes slowly when you’re lost in a dream

Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking
Stared out the window to the stars high above
Time passes slowly when you’re searching for love

Ain’t no reason to go in a wagon to town
Ain’t no reason to go to the fair
Ain’t no reason to go up, ain’t no reason to go down
Ain’t no reason to go anywhere

Time passes slowly up here in the daylight
We stare straight ahead and try so hard to stay right
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
Time passes slowly and fades awayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Forever Young (Demo),"May God bless and keep you always

And let others do for you
May you build a ladder to the stars
And climb on every rung

Forever young, forever young
May you stay forever young
May you grow up to be righteous
May you grow up to be true
May you always know the truth

May you always be courageous
Stand upright and be strong

Forever young, forever young
May you stay forever young

May you have a strong foundation
When the winds of changes shift
May your heart always be joyful
May your song always be sung
May you stay forever young
Forever young, forever young

Positively Van Gogh,"When I'd ask why the painting was deadly
Nobody could pick up my sign
'Cept for the cook, she was always friendly
But she'd only ask, ""What's on your mind?""
She'd say that especially when it was raining
I'd say ""Oh, I don't know""
But then she'd press and I'd say, ""You see that painting?
Do you think it's been done by Van Gogh?""

The cook she said call her Maria
She'd always point for the same boy to come forth
Saying, ""He trades cattle, it's his own idea
And he also makes trips to the North
Have you ever seen his naked calf bleed?""
I'd say, ""Oh no, why does it show?""
And she'd whisper in my ear that he's a half-breed
And I'd say, ""Fine, but can he paint like Van Gogh?""

I can't remember his name he never gave it
But I always figured he could go home
Til when he'd gave me his card and said, ""Save it""
I could see by his eyes he was alone
But it was sad how his four leaf clover
Drawn on his calling card showed
That it was given back to him a-many times over
And it most definitely was not done by Van Gogh
It was either she or the maid just to please me
Though I sensed she could not understand
And she made a thing out of it by saying, ""Go easy
He's a straight, but he's a very crooked straight man.""
And I'd say, ""Does the girl in the calendar doubt it?
And by the way is it Marilyn Monroe?""
But she'd just speak softly and say, ""Why you wanna know about it?""
And I'd say, ""I was just wondering if she ever sat for Van Gogh.""

It was either her or the straight man who introduced me
To Jeanette, Camilla's friend
Who later on falsely accused me of stealing her locket and pen
When I said ""I don't have the locket""
She said ""You steal pictures of everybody's mother I know""
And I said ""There's no locket
No picture of any mother I would pocket
Unless it's been done by Van Gogh.""

Camilla's house stood on the outskirts
How strange to see the chandeliers destroyed
While  beneath the velvet carpet
Of fox hunts and love far beforeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
P.S. I Love You,"Dear, I thought I'd drop a line
The weather's cool. The folks are fine
I'm in bed each night at nine
P.S. I love you
Yesterday we had some rain
But all in all I can't complain
Was it dusty on the train?
P.S. I love you
Write to the Browns just as soon as you're able
They came around to call
I burned a hole in the dining room table
And let me see, I guess that's all
Nothin' else for me to say
And so I'll close. Oh, by the way
Everybody's thinkin' of you
P.S. I love you
I do my best to obey all your wishes
I put a sign up. Think
Now I got to buy us a new set of dishes
Or wash the ones that have piled in the sink
Nothing else to tell you, dear
Except, each day feels like a year
Every night I'm dreamin' of you
P.S. I love you
P.S. I love youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Tough Mama,"Tough Mama
Meat shaking on your bones
I’m gonna go down to the river and get some stones
Sister’s on the highway with that steel-drivin’ crew
Papa’s in the big house, his working’ days are through
Tough Mama
Can I blow a little smoke on you?

Dark Beauty
Won’t you move over and give me some room?
It’s my duty to bring you down to the field where the flowers bloom
Ashes in the furnace, dust on the rise
You came through it all the way, flying through the skies
Dark Beauty
With that long night’s journey in your eyes

Sweet Goddess
Born of a blinding light and a changing wind
Now, don’t be modest, you know who you are and where you’ve been
Jack the Cowboy went up north
He’s buried in your past
The Lone Wolf went out drinking
That was over pretty fast
Sweet Goddess
Your perfect stranger’s comin’ in at last
Silver Angel
With the badge of the lonesome road sewed in your sleeve
I’d be grateful if this golden ring you would receive
Today on the countryside it was a-hotter than a crotch
I stood alone upon the ridge and all I did was watch
Sweet Goddess
It must be time to carve another notch

I’m crestfallen
The world of illusion is at my door
I ain’t a-hauling any of my lambs to the marketplace anymore
The prison walls are crumbling down, there is no end in sight
I’ve gained some recognition but I lost my appetite
Dark Beauty
Meet me at the border late tonightEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Stardust,"Sometimes I wonder
Why I spend my lonely nights
Dreaming of a song
The melody haunts my reverie
And I am once again with you
When our love was new
And each kiss an inspiration
Oh, but that was long ago
And now my consolation is in the stardust of a song
Beside the garden wall, when stars were bright
You are in my arms
The nightingale told his fairytale
Of paradise, where roses grew
Though I dream in vain
In my heart, it will always remain
My stardust melody
The memory of love's refrainEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Peggy Day,"Peggy Day stole my poor heart away

Man, that girl is out of sight
Love to spend the day with Peggy Night

Well, ya' know that even before I learned her name
Ya' know I loved her just the same
And I tell ’em all, wherever I may go
Just so they’ll know, that she my little lady
And I love her so

Peggy Day stole my poor heart away
Turned my skies to blue from gray
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day


Peggy Day stole my poor heart away
By golly, what more can I say?
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day

The Groom’s Still Waiting at the Altar,"Prayed in the ghetto with my face in the cement
Heard the last moan of a boxer, seen the massacre of the innocent
Felt around for the light switch, felt around for her face
Been treated like a farm animal on a wild goose chase

West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar
I see the turning of the page
Curtain rising on a new age
See the groom still waiting at the altar

Try to be pure at heart, they arrest you for robbery
Mistake your shyness for aloofness, your silence for snobbery
Got the message this morning, the one that was sent to me
About the madness of becoming what one was never meant to be

West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar
I see the turning of the page
Curtain rising on a new age
See the groom still waiting at the altar

Don't know what I can say about Claudette that wouldn't come back to haunt me
Finally had to give her up 'bout the time she began to want me
But I know God has mercy on them who are slandered and humiliated
I'd a-done anything for that woman if she’d only made me feel obligated
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar
I see the turning of the page
Curtain rising on a new age
See the groom still waiting at the altar

Put your hand on my head, baby, do I have a temperature?
I see people who are supposed to know better standing around like furniture
There's a wall between you and what you want and you got to leap it
Tonight you got the power to take it, tomorrow you won't have the power to
Keep it

West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar
I see the turning of the page
Curtain rising on a new age
See the groom still waiting at the altar

Cities on fire, phones out of order
They're killing nuns and soldiers, there's fighting on the border
What can I say about Claudette?
Ain't seen her since January
She could be respectably married or running a whorehouse in Buenos Aires
West of the Jordan, east of the Rock of Gibraltar
I see the turning of the page
Curtain rising on a new age
See the groom still waiting at the altar2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Billy 7,"Spend the night with some sweet señorita
Into her dark hallway she will lead you
In some lonesome shadow she might greet you
Billy, you’re so doggone far away from home
They say that Pat Garrett’s got your number
Sleep with one eye open when you slumber
Every little sound just might be thunder
Thunder from the barrel of his gun
Maybe you will find yourself tomorrow
Drinking in some bar to hide your sorrow
Spending the time that you borrow
Figuring a way to get back homeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Gonna Change My Way of Thinking,"Change my way of thinking

Gonna change my way of thinking
Make myself a different set of rules
Going to put my good foot forward
Stop being influenced by fools

So much oppression
Can't keep track of it no more
So much oppression
Can't keep track of it no more
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers
Old men turning young daughters into whores

Stripes on your shoulders
Stripes on your back and on your hands
Stripes on your shoulders
Stripes on your back and on your hands
Swords piercing your side
Blood and water flowing through the land

Well, I don't know which one is worse
Doing your own thing or just being cool
Don't know which one is worse
Doing your own thing or being cool
You remember only about the brass ring
You forget all about the golden rule
You can mislead a man
You can take ahold of his heart with your eyes
You can mislead a man
You can take ahold of his heart with your eyes
But there's only one authority
And that's the authority on high

I got a God-fearing woman
One I can easily afford
I got a God-fearing woman
One I can easily afford
She can do the Georgia Crawl
She can walk in the Spirit of the Lord

Jesus said, ""Be ready
For you know not the hour in which I come""
Jesus said, ""Be ready
For you know not the hour in which I come""
He said, ""He who is not for Me is against Me""
Just so you know where He's coming from

There's a kingdom called Heaven
A place where there is no pain of birth
There's a place called Heaven
A place where there is no pain of birth
Well the Lord created it, mister
About the same time that He made the earth

Every day you got to pray for guidance
Every day you got to give yourself a chance

Hard Times in New York Town (Demo),"Come you ladies and you gentlemen, a-listen to my song
Sing it to you right, but you might think it’s wrong
Just a little glimpse of a story I’ll tell
’Bout an East Coast city that you all know well
It’s hard times in the city
Living’ down in New York town

Old New York City is a friendly old town
From Washington Heights to Harlem on down
There’s a-mighty many people all milling’ all around
They’ll kick you when you’re up and knock you when you’re down
It’s hard times in the city
Living’ down in New York town

Well, the weekend is strong and the rich and the poor
Get there together in roof an' no more
Crowdin' up 'bove and crowdin' down below
And someone disappears, you never even know
And it's hard times from the country, livin' down in New York town

It’s a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
To Rockefeller Plaza ’n’ the Empire State
Mister Empire sets up as high as a bird
Old Mister Rockefeller never says a word
It’s hard times from the country
Living’ down in New York town
Well, it’s up in the morning’ trying’ to find a job of work
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt
If you got a lot o’ money you can make yourself merry
If you only got a nickel, it’s the Staten Island Ferry
And it’s hard times in the city
Living’ down in New York town

Mister Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
And old Mister Minuet paid for his dream
Bought your city on a one-way track
’F I had my way I’d sell it right back
And it’s hard times in the city
Living’ down in New York town

I’ll take all the smog in Cal-i-for-ne-ay
’N’ every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
’N’ the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines
It’s all much cleaner than the New York kind
And it’s hard times in the city
Living’ down in New York town

So all you newsy people, spread the news around
You can listen to m’ story, listen to m’ song
You can step on my name, you can try ’n’ get me beat
When I leave New York, I’ll be standing’ on my feet
And it’s hard times in the city
Living’ down in New York town1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Don’t trust me to show you love
When my love may be only lust

A nasty, dirty, double-crossin’, backstabbin’ phony I didn’t wanna have to be dealin’ with

It must have been Don Pasqualli makin’ a two A.M. booty call
To break a trusting heart like mine was just your style
Well, I cried for you, now it’s your turn to cry awhile

I’m on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can’t control
Some people they ain’t human, they got no heart or soul
Well, I’m crying to the Lord, I’m tryin’ to be meek and mild
Yes, I cried for you, now it’s your turn, you can cry awhile
Well, there’s preachers in the pulpits and babies in the cribs
I’m longin’ for that sweet fat that sticks to your ribs
I’m gonna buy me a barrel of whiskey, I’ll die before I turn senile
Well, I cried for you, now it’s your turn, you can cry awhile

Well, you bet on a horse and it ran on the wrong way

Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?,"He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks
Preoccupied with his vengeance
Cursing the dead that can’t answer him back
I’m sure that he has no intentions
Of looking your way, unless it’s to say
That he needs you to test his inventions

Can you please crawl out your window?
Use your arms and legs it won’t ruin you
How can you say he will haunt you?
You can go back to him any time you want to

He looks so truthful, is this how he feels
Trying to peel the moon and expose it
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel
If he needs a third eye he just grows it
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk
Or pick it up after he throws it


Why does he look so righteous while your face is so changed
Are you frightened of the box you keep him in
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
Their religion of the little tin women
That backs up their views but your face is so bruised
Come on out the dark is beginning

The Boxer,"I'm just a poor boy
Though my story's seldom told
I have squadered my resistance
For a pocketful of numbles
Such are promises, all lies and jest
Still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest

When I left my home and family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station
Running scared, laying low
Seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know

Asking only workman's wages
I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue
I do declare
There were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
And wishing I was gone, going home
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
Leading me
Going home

In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down
And cut him till he cried out
In his anger and his shame
""I am leaving, I am leaving""
But the fighter still remainsEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Lily of the West,"When first I came to Louisville, some pleasure there to find
A damsel there from Lexington was pleasing to my mind
Her rosy cheeks, her ruby lips, like arrows pierced my breast
And the name she bore was Flora, the lily of the west

I courted lovely Flora some pleasure for to find
But she turned unto another man whose sore distressed my mind
She robbed me of my liberty, deprived me of my rest
Then go, my lovely Flora, the lily of the west

Away down in yonder shady grove, a man of high degree
Conversing with my Flora there, it seemed so strange to me
And the answer that she gave to him it sore did me oppress
I was betrayed by Flora, the lily of the west

I stepped up my rival, dagger in my hand
I seized him by the collar, and body made him stand
Seeing mad by desperation I pierced him to the breast
All this for lovely Flora, the lily of the west

I had to stand my trial, I had to make my plea
They placed me in the witness box and then commenced on me
Although she swore my life away, deprived me of my rest
Still I love my faithless Flora, the Lily of the westEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Caribbean Wind,"She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost
From the city of seven hills near the place of the cross
I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy
Told about Jesus, told about the rain
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
By a man who had been dying and disappeared so mysteriously

Was she a child or an angel? Did we go too far
Were we sniper bait? Did we follow a star?
To a hole in the wall wall to where the long arm of the law can not reach?
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
Where men bathed in perfume and practiced the hopes of free speech

And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free
Bringing everything that’s near to me nearer to the fire

She looked into my soul through the clothes that I wore
She said, “We got a mutual friend over by the door
And you know he’s got our best interest in mind”
He was well connected but her heart was a snare
And she had left him to die in there
There were payments due and he was a little behind
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head
Ceiling fan broken, there’s a heat in my bed
Street band playing “Nearer My God to Thee”
We met at the steeple where the mission bells ring
She said, “I know what you’re thinking, but there ain’t a thing
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree”

And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free
Bringing everything that’s near to me nearer to the fire

Atlantic City by the cold grey sea
I hear a voice crying, “Daddy,” I always think it’s for me
But it’s only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call
Every new messenger brings evil report
’Bout armies on the march and time that is short
And famines and earthquakes and hatred written upon walls

Would I have married her? I don’t know, I suppose
She had bells in her braids and they hung to her toes
But I kept hearing my name and had to be moving on
I saw screws break loose, saw the devil pound tin
I saw a house in the country being torn from within
I heard my ancestors calling from the land far beyond
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free
Bringing everything that’s near to me nearer to the fireEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

And there's one last favor I'll ask for you
And just one last flavor I'll ask for you

Lay Down Your Weary Tune,"Lay down your weary tune, lay down
Lay down the song you strum
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings
No voice can hope to hum

Struck by the sounds before the sun
I knew the night had gone
The morning breeze like a bugle blew
Against the drums of dawn


The ocean wild like an organ played
The seaweed's wove its strands
The crashing waves like cymbals clashed
Against the rocks and sands


I stood unwound beneath the skies
And clouds unbound by laws
The crying rain like a trumpet sang
And asked for no applause

The last of leaves fell from the trees
And clung to a new love's breast
The branches bare like a banjo played
To the winds that listened best
I gazed down in the river's mirror
And watched its winding strum
The water smooth ran like a hymn
And like a harp did hum

Foot of Pride,"Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male
They sang “Danny Boy” at his funeral and the Lord’s Prayer
Preacher talking ’bout Christ betrayed
It’s like the earth just opened and swallowed him up
He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground
You know what they say about being nice to the right people on the way up
Sooner or later you gonna meet them coming down

Well, there ain’t no goin’ back
When your foot of pride come down
Ain’t no goin’ back

Hear ya got a brother named James, don’t forget faces or names
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed
He looked straight into the sun and said revenge is mine
But he drinks, and drinks can be fixed
Sing me one more song, about ya love me to the moon and the stranger
And your fall-by-the sword love affair with Errol Flynn
In these times of compassion when conformity’s in fashion
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in

There’s a retired businessman named Red
Cast down from heaven and he’s out of his head
He feeds off of everyone that he can touch
He said he only deals in cash or sells tickets to a plane crash
He’s not somebody that you play around with much
Miss Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is
She’ll do wondrous works with your fate
Feed you coconut bread
Spice buns in your bed
If you don’t mind sleeping with your head face down in a grave


Well, they’ll choose a man for you to meet tonight
You’ll play the fool and learn how to walk through the doors
How to enter into the gates of paradise
No, how to carry a burden too heavy to be yours
Yeah, from the stage they’ll be trying’ to get water out rocks
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand and say thanks
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in
Sing “Amazing Grace” all the way to the Swiss banks

They got some beautiful people out there, man
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue
They got mystery written all over their forehead
They kill babies in the crib and say only the good die young
They don’t believe in mercy
Judgement on them is something that you’ll never see
They can exalt you up or bring you down main route
Turn you into anything that they want you to be


Yes, I guess I loved him too
I can still see him in my mind climbin’ that hill
Did he make it to the top, well he probably did and dropped
Struck down by the strength of the will
Ain’t nothin’ left here partner, just the dust of a plague
That has left this whole town afraid
From now on, this’ll be where you’re from
Let the dead bury the dead. Your time will come
Let hot iron blow as he raised the shade

Emotionally Yours,"Come baby, find me, come baby, remind me of where I once begun
Come baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you’re the one
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors
But I will always be emotionally yours

Come baby, rock me, come baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart
Come baby, teach me, come baby, reach me, let the music start
I could be dreaming but I keep believing you’re the one I’m living for
And I will always be emotionally yours

It’s like my whole life never happened
When I see you, it’s as if I never had a thought
I know this dream, it might be crazy
But it’s the only one I’ve got

Come baby, shake me, come baby, take me, I would be satisfied
Come baby, hold me, come baby, help me, my arms are open wide
I could be unraveling wherever I’m traveling, even to foreign shores
But I will always be emotionally yoursEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
World Gone Wrong,"Strange things have happened, like never before

Feel bad this morning, ain't got no home
No use in worrying, 'cause the world gone wrong
I can't be good no more, once like I did before

I tried to be loving and treat you kind
But it seems like you never right, you got no loyal mind
I can't be good no more, once like I did before
I can't be good, baby
Honey, because the world's gone wrong
If you have a woman and she don't treat you kind
Praise the Good Lord to get her out of your mind
I can't be good no more, once like I did before
I can't be good, baby
Honey, because the world's gone wrong

Said, when you been good now, can't do no more
Just tell her kindly, ""there is the front door.""
I can't be good no more, once like I did before
I can't be good, baby
Honey, because the world's gone wrong

Pack up my suitcase, give me my hat
No use to ask me, baby, 'cause I'll never be back
I can't be good no more, once like I did before
I can't be good, baby
Honey, because the world's gone wrong1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Silvio,"Stake my future on a hell of a past
Looks like tomorrow is coming on fast
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got
Seen better times, but who has not?

Silvio
Silver and gold
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold
Silvio
I gotta go
Find out something only dead men know

Honest as the next jade rolling that stone
When I come knocking don't throw me no bone
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
If you don't like it you can leave me alone

I can snap my fingers and require the rain
From a clear blue sky and turn it off again
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain
And charm the whistle off an evening train
I give what I got until I got no more
I take what I get until I even the score
You know I love you and furthermore
When it's time to go you got an open door

I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain
You give something up for everything you gain
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain
Pay for your ticket and don't complain

One of these days and it won't be long
Going down in the valley and sing my song
I will sing it loud and sing it strong
Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong

Silver and gold
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold

I gotta go
Find out something only dead men know1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Never Say Goodbye,"Twilight on the frozen lake
North wind about to break
On footprints in the snow
Silence down below

You’re beautiful beyond words
You’re beautiful to me
You can make me cry
Never say goodbye

Time is all I have to give
You can have it if you choose
With me you can live
Never say goodbye

My dreams are made of iron and steel
With a big bouquet
Of roses hanging down
From the heavens to the ground

The crashing waves roll over me
As I stand upon the sand
Wait for you to come
And grab hold of my hand
Oh, baby, baby, baby blue
You’ll change your last name, too
You’ve turned your hair to brown
Love to see it hanging’ downEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Dreamin’ of You,"The light in this place is really bad
Like being at the bottom of a stream
Any minute now
I’m expecting to wake up from a dream

Means so much, the softest touch
By the grave of some child, who neither wept or smiled
I pondered my faith in the rain
I’ve been dreaming’ of you, that’s all I do
And it’s driving me insane

Somewhere dawn is breaking
Light is streaking across the floor
Church bells are ringing
I wonder who they’re ringing for

Travel under any star
You’ll see me wherever you are
The shadowy past is awake and so vast
I’m sleeping in the palace of pain
I’ve been dreaming’ of you, that’s all I do
But it’s driving me insane
Maybe they’ll get me, maybe they won’t
But whatever it won’t be tonight
I wish your hand was in mine right now
We could go where the moon is white

For years they had me locked in a cage
Then they threw me onto the stage
Some things just last longer than you thought they would
And they never, ever explain
I’ve been dreaming’ of you, that’s all I do
And it’s driving me insane

Well, I eat when I’m hungry, drink when I’m dry
Live my life on the square
Even if the flesh falls off my face
It won’t matter, long as you’re there

Feel like a ghost in love
Underneath the heavens above
Feel further away than I ever did before
Feel further than I can take
Dreaming’ of you is all I do
But it’s driving me insane
Everything in the way is so shiny today
A queer and unusual fall
Spirals of golden haze, here and there in a blaze
Like beams of light in the storm

Maybe you were here and maybe you weren’t
Maybe you touched somebody and got burnt
The silent sun has got me on the run
Burning a hole in my brain
I’m dreaming’ of you, that’s all I do
But it’s driving me insane1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Just like you, I’m wondering what’s going on


I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
And I know that you’re gonna be mine one of these days

If Dogs Run Free,"If dogs run free, then why not we
Across the swooping plain?
My ears hear a symphony
Of two mules, trains and rain
The best is always yet to come
That’s what they explain to me
Just do your thing, you’ll be king
If dogs run free

If dogs run free, why not me
Across the swamp of time?
My mind weaves a symphony
And tapestry of rhyme
Oh, winds which rush my tale to thee
So it may flow and be
To each his own, it’s all unknown
If dogs run free

If dogs run free, then what must be
Must be, and that is all
True love can make a blade of grass
Stand up straight and tall
In harmony with the cosmic sea
True love needs no company
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole
If dogs run freeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
You Changed My Life,"I was listening to the voices of death on parade
Singing about conspiracy, wanted me to be afraid
Working for a system I couldn't understand or trust
Suffered ridicule and wanting to give it all up in disgust

But you changed my life
Came along in a time of strife
In hunger and need, you made my heart bleed
You changed my life

Talk about salvation, people suddenly get tired
They got a million things to do, they're all so inspired
You do the work of the devil, you got a million friends
They'll be there when you got something, they'll take it all in the end

But you changed my life
Came along in a time of strife
In hunger and need, you made my heart bleed
You changed my life

Well, the nature of man is to beg and to steal
I do it myself, it's not so unreal
The call of the wild is forever at my door
Wants me to fly like an eagle while being chained to the floor
But you changed my life
Came along in a time of strife
In hunger and need, you made my heart bleed
You changed my life

I was eating with the pigs off a fancy tray
I was told i was looking good and to have a nice day
It all seemed so proper, it all seemed so elite
Eating that absolute garbage while being so discreet

But you changed my life
Came along in a time of strife
In hunger and need, you made my heart bleed
You changed my life

You were glowing in the sun while being peaceably calm
While orphans of man danced to the beat of the palm
Your eyes were on fire, your feet were of brass
In the world you had made they made you an outcast

But you changed my life
Came along in a time of strife
In hunger and need, you made my heart bleed
You changed my life
There was someone in my body that I could hardly see
Invading my privacy making my decisions for me
Holding me back, not letting me stand
Making me feel like a stranger in a strange land

But you changed my life
Came along in a time of strife
In hunger and need, you made my heart bleed
You changed my life

My Lord and my Savior, my companion, my friend
Heart fixer, mind regulator, true to the end
My creator, my comforter, my cause for joy
What the world is set against but will never destroy

But you changed my life
Came along in a time of strife
In hunger and need, you made my heart bleed
You changed my lifeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

The Ballad of Ira Hayes,"Gather round you people and a story I will tell
About a brave young Indian you should remember well
From the tribe of Pima Indians, a proud and a peaceful band
They farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona land
Down their ditches for a thousand years the sparkling water rushed
Till their white man stole their water rights and the running water hushed
Now Ira's folks were hungry and their farms when crops of weeds
But when war came he volunteers and forgot, the white man's greed
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
Yes, call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war

They started up Iwo Jima Hill, 250 men
But only 27 lived to walk back down that hill again
And when the fight was over and the old glory raised
One of the men who held it high was the Indian Ira Hayes
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war

Now Ira returned a hero, celebrated throughout the land
He was wined and speeched and honored, everybody shook his hand
But he was just a Pima Indian, no money crops, no chance
And at home nobody cared what Ira had done and the wind did the Indian's dance
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
And Ira started drinking hard, jail was often his home
They let him raise the flag there and lower it like you'd throw a dog a bone
He died drunk early one morning, alone in the land he had fought to save
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch was the grave for Ira Hayes
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
Yes, call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war

Yes, call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, but his land is still as dry
And his ghost is lying thirsty in the ditch where Ira died
Call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to war
Yes, call him, Drunken Ira Hayes, he won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey-drinking Indian or the marine who went to warEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Polka Dots and Moonbeams,"A country dance was being held in a garden
I felt a bump and heard an, ""Oh, beg your pardon""
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams
All around a pug-nosed dream

The music started and was I the perplexed one?
I held my breath and said, ""May I have the next one?""
In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

There were questions in the eyes of other dancers
As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more

Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words, ""ever after""
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams
When I kiss the pug-nosed dreamEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
True Love Tends to Forget,"I’m getting weary looking in my baby’s eyes
When she’s near me she’s so hard to recognize
I finally realize there’s no room for regret
True love, true love, true love tends to forget

Hold me, baby be near
You told me that you’d be sincere
Every day of the year’s like playing’ Russian roulette
True love, true love, true love tends to forget

I was lying’ down in the reeds without any oxygen
I saw you in the wilderness among the men
Saw you drift into infinity and come back again
All you got to do is wait and I’ll tell you when

You’re a tearjerker, baby, but I’m under your spell
You’re a hard worker, baby, and I know you well
But this weekend in hell is making me sweat
True love, true love, true love tends to forget

You belong to me, baby, without any doubt
Don’t forsake me, baby, don’t sell me out
Don’t keep me knocking’ about from Mexico to Tibet
True love, true love, true love tends to forget1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Shot of Love,"I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love

Don’t need a shot of heroin to kill my disease
Don’t need a shot of turpentine, only bring me to my knees
Don’t need a shot of codeine to help me to repent
Don’t need a shot of whiskey, help me be president


Doctor, can you hear me? I need some Medicaid
I seen the kingdoms of the world and it’s making me feel afraid
What I got ain’t painful, it’s just bound to kill me dead
Like the men that followed Jesus when they put a price upon His head


I don’t need no alibi when I’m spending time with you
I’ve heard all of them rumors and you have heard them too
Don’t show me no picture show or give me no book to read
It don’t satisfy the hurt inside nor the habit that it feeds

Why would I want to take your life?
You’ve only murdered my father, raped his wife
Tattooed my babies with a poison pen
Mocked my God, humiliated my friends


Don’t want to be with nobody tonight
Veronica not around nowhere, Mavis just ain’t right
There’s a man that hates me and he’s swift, smooth and near
Am I supposed to set back and wait until he’s here?


What makes the wind want to blow tonight?
Don’t even feel like crossing the street and my car ain’t actin’ right
Called home, everybody seemed to have moved away
My conscience is beginning to bother me today


I need a shot of love, I need a shot of love
If you’re a doctor, I need a shot of loveEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

My one and only love
The touch of your hand is like heaven
A heaven that I've never known
And the blush on your cheek whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own
You fill my eager heart with such desire
Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire
I give myself in sweet surrender
My one and only love

So weary all of the time

When she went away
The blues walked in and they met
If she stays away that old rocking chair's gonna get me
All I do is pray the Lord above is gonna let me
Walk in the sun once more

Can't go on
Everything I have is gone
Stormy weather
Since my gal and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time
Keeps raining all of the timeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Lord Protect My Child,"For his age, he’s wise
He’s got his mother’s eyes
There’s gladness in his heart
He’s young and he’s wild
My only prayer is, if I can’t be there
Lord, protect my child

As his youth now unfolds
He is centuries old
Just to see him at play makes me smile
No matter what happens to me
No matter what my destiny
Lord, protect my child

The whole world is asleep
You can look at it and weep
Few things you find are worthwhile
And though I don’t ask for much
No material things to touch
Lord, protect my child

He’s young and on fire
Full of hope and desire
In a world that’s been raped and defiled
If I fall along the way
And can’t see another day
Lord, protect my child
There’ll be a time I hear tell
When all will be well
When God and man will be reconciled
But until men lose their chains
And righteousness reigns
Lord, protect my childEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
O’ Little Town of Bethlehem,"O' little town of Bethlehem
How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shine
An everlasting Light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight

How silently, how silently
The wondrous gift is given
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of all His heaven
No ear may hear His coming
But in this world of sin
Where meek souls will receive Him still
The dear Christ enters in
AmenEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
"If You See Her, Say Hello (9/16/74, Take 1)","If you see her say hello she might be in Tangier
She left here last early spring, Is living there I hear
Say for me that I'm alright, though new things come and go
She might think that I’ve forgotten her, don't tell her it isn't so

We had a fallen out, like lovers often will
But to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill
And though our separation it pierced me to the heart
She still lives inside of me, we’ve never been apart

If you're making love to her, kiss her for the kid
Who always has respected her for doing what she did
Oh, I know it had to be that way, It was written in the cards
Still the bitter taste still lingers on, it all came down so hard

I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
And I hear her name both here and there as I go from town to town
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off
Either I'm too sensitive, or else I'm getting soft

Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast
If she's passing back this way, I'm not that hard to find
Tell her she can look me up, If she’s got the timeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Why Was I Born?,"Why was I born tell me why I am living
What do I give or what am I'm giving
What do I want anything I can not hope for
What can I hope for I wish I knew
Why do I try to draw you near me
Honey tell me why do I cry
Cause you're never gonna hear me
I'm a poor fool
But what can I do, I do
Why was I born to love you
Why do I try to draw you near me
Honey tell me why do I cry
Cause you're never gonna hear me
I'm a poor fool
But what can I do, I do
Why was I born to love youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
When the Night Comes Falling from the Sky,"Look out across the fields, see me returning
Smoke is in your eye, you draw a smile
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning
You’ve had time to think about it for a while

Well, I’ve walked two hundred miles, now look me over
It’s the end of the chase and the moon is high
It won’t matter who loves who
You’ll love me or I’ll love you
When the night comes falling
When the night comes falling
When the night comes falling from the sky

I can see through your walls and I know you’re hurting
Sorrow covers you up like a cape
Only yesterday I know that you’ve been flirting
With disaster you somehow managed to escape

Well, I can’t provide for you no easy answers
Who are you that I should have to lie?
You’ll know all about it, love
It’ll fit you like a glove
When the night comes falling
When the night comes falling
When the night comes falling from the sky

I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
You must have been protecting someone last time I called
I’ve never asked you for nothing that you couldn’t deliver
I’ve never asked you to set yourself up for a fall

I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness
For the love of a lousy buck, I’ve watched them die
Stick around, baby, we’re not through
Don’t look for me, I’ll see you
When the night comes falling
When the night comes falling
When the night comes falling from the sky

In your teardrops, I can see my own reflection
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line
I don’t want to be a fool starving for affection
I don’t want to drown in someone else’s wine

For all eternity I think I will remember
That icy wind that’s howling in your eye
You will seek me and you’ll find me
In the wasteland of your mind
When the night comes falling
When the night comes falling
When the night comes falling from the sky
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter
But you were gambling for support
This time tomorrow I’ll know you better
When my memory is not so short

This time I’m asking for freedom
Freedom from a world which you deny
And you’ll give it to me now
I’ll take it anyhow
When the night comes falling
When the night comes falling
When the night comes falling from the sky1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
"Idiot Wind (9/19/74, Take 4, Remake)","Someone’s got it in for me, they’re planting stories in the press
Whoever it is I wish they’d cut it, but when they will I can only guess
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy
She inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me
I can’t help it if I’m lucky

People see me all the time and they just can’t remember how to act
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images and distorted facts
Even you, yesterday you had to ask me where it was at
I couldn’t believe after all these years, you didn’t know me any better than that
Sweet lady

Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your mouth
Going down the backroads heading south
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth
You’re an idiot, babe
It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe

I threw the I-Ching yesterday, it said there'd be some thunder at the well
I haven't tasted peace and quiet, for so long it seems like living hell
There’s a lone soldier on the hill, watching falling raindrops pour
You'd never know it to look at him, at the final shot he won the war
After losing every battle
I woke up on the roadside, daydreaming about the way things sometimes are
Hoofbeats pounding in my head, at break-neck speed and making me see stars
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies
One day you’ll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes
Blood on your saddle

Idiot wind, blowing through the flowers on your tomb
Blowing through the curtains in your room
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth
You’re an idiot, babe
It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe

It was gravity which pulled us in and destiny which broke us apart
You tamed the lion in my cage but it just wasn’t enough to change my heart
Now everything’s a little upside down, as a matter of fact the wheels have stopped
What’s good is bad, what’s bad is good, you’ll find out when you reach the top
You’re on the bottom

I noticed at the ceremony, that you left your bags behind
The driver came in after you left, he gave them all to me, and then he resigned
The priest wore black on the seventh day and waltzed around while the building burned
You didn't trust me for a minute babe, I've never known the Spring to turn so quickly into Autumn
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your jaw
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Mardi Gras
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth
You’re an idiot, babe
It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe

We pushed each other a little too far, and one day it just turned into a raging storm
The hound dog bayed beyond your trees, as I was packing up my uniform
Well, I figured I’d lost you anyway, why go on? What’s the use?
In order to get in a word with you
I’d have had to come up with some kind of excuse
And it just struck me kind of funny

I've been double-crossed too much, at times I think I've almost lost my mind
Ladykillers load dice on me, behind my back, while imitators steal me blind
You close your eyes and pout your lips and slip your fingers from your glove
You can have the best there is but it's going to cost you all your love
You won't get it for money

Idiot wind, blowing through the buttons of our coats
Blowing through the letters that we wrote
Idiot wind, blowing through the dust upon our shelves
We’re idiots, babe
It’s a wonder we can even feed ourselvesEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Life Is Hard,"The evening winds are still
I've lost the way and will
Can't tell you where they went
I just know what they meant
I'm always on my guard
Admitting life is hard
Without you near me

The friend you used to be
So near and dear to me
You slipped so far away
Where did we go a-stray
I pass the old schoolyard
Admitting life is hard
Without you near me

Ever since the day
The day you went away
I felt that emptiness so wide
I don't know what's wrong or right
I just know I need strength to fight
Strength to fight that world outside
Since we've been out of touch
I haven't felt that much
From day to barren day
My heart stays locked away
I walk the boulevard
Admitting life is hard
Without you near me

The sun is sinking low
I guess it's time to go
I feel a chilly breeze
In place of memories
My dreams are locked and barred
Admitting life is hard
Without you near me1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Hazel,"Hazel, dirty-blonde hair
I wouldn’t be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere
You got something I want plenty of
Ooh, a little touch of your love

Hazel, stardust in your eye
You’re going somewhere and so am I
I’d give you the sky high above
Ooh, for a little touch of your love

Oh no, I don’t need any reminder
To know how much I really care
But it’s just making me blinder and blinder
Because I’m up on a hill and still you’re not there

Hazel, you called and I came
Now don’t make me play this waiting game
You’ve got something I want plenty of
Ooh, a little touch of your loveEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Pretty Boy Floyd,"If you'll gather 'round me, people
A story, I will tell
About Pretty Boy Floyd, an outlaw
Oklahoma knew him well
It was in the town of Shawnee
On a Saturday afternoon
His wife beside him in a wagon
As into town they rode
There a deputy sheriff approached him
In a manner rather rude
Using vulgar words of language
An' his wife, she overheard
Pretty Boy grabbed a log chain
And the deputy grabbed his gun
And in the fight that followed
He laid that deputy down
Now, he took to the hills and timber
To live the life of shame
Every crime in Oklahoma
Was added to his name
He took to the trees and timber
On the Canadian river shore
And Pretty Boy found a welcome
At every farmer's door
Others tell you of a stranger
That come to beg a meal
And underneath the napkin
Left a thousand-dollar bill
'Twas in Oklahoma City
It was on a Christmas Day
There come a whole car load of groceries
And a letter that did say:
You say that I'm an outlaw
You say that I'm a thief
Well, here's a Christmas dinner
For the families on relief
Well, it's through this world I've rambled
I've seen lots of funny men
Some will rob you with a six-gun
And some with a fountain pen
Well, it's through this world you ramble
It's through this world you roam
You won't never see an outlaw
Drive a family from their homeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
You Angel You,"You angel, you
Your essence got me under your wing
The way you walk and the way you talk
I feel I could almost sing
You angel, you
You're as fine as anything's fine
I just walk and watch you talk
With you memory of my mind
You know I can't sleep at night for trying
Yes I never did feel this way before
Never did get up and walk the floor
If this is love then gimme more
And more and more and more and more
You angel, you
You're as fine as can be
The way you walk and the way you talk
Is the way it ought to be
And oh, I can't sleep at night for trying
Never did feel this way before
Never did get up and walk the floor
If this is love then gimme more
And more and more and more
You angel, you
You got me under your wing
The way you walk and the way you talk
I swear it would make me singEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Turkey Chase,
Young at Heart,"Fairy tales can come true
It can happen to you if you're young at heart
For it's hard, you will find
To be narrow of mind if you're young at heart

You can go to extremes with impossible schemes
You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams
And life gets more exciting with each passing day
And love is either in your heart or on it's way

Don't you know that it's worth
Every treasure on earth to be young at heart?
For as rich as you are
It's much better by far to be young at heart

And if you should survive to a hundred and five
Look at all you'll derive out of being alive
And here is the best part, you have a head start
If you are among the very young at heart

And if you should survive to a hundred and five
Look at all you'll derive out of being alive
And here is the best part, you have a head start
If you are among the very young at heartEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Like a Rolling Stone (Live),"Once upon a time you dressed so fine
You threw the bums a dime in your prime
Didn't you?
People'd call, say: ""Beware, doll, you're bound to fall""
You thought they were all
Kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hanging out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging
For your next meal
How does it feel?
How does it feel
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?
Oh, you've gone to the finest school, alright, miss lonely
But you know you only used to get
Juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
And now you're gonna have to get
Used to it
You say you'd never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say: ""Do you want to
Make a deal?""
How does it feel?
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?
Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did
Tricks for you
You never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your
Kicks for you
You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything
He could steal?
How does it feel?
How does it feel
To hang on your home
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?
Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinking thinking that they
Got it made
Exchanging all their precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring
You'd better pawn it, baby
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose
You're invisible now, you got no secrets
To conceal
How does it feel?
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
I’ll Remember You,"I'll remember you
When I've forgotten all the rest
You to me were true
You to me were the best
When there is no more
You cut to the core
Quicker than anyone I knew
When I'm all alone
In the great unknown
I'll remember you

I'll remember you
At the end of the trail
I had so much left to do
I had so little time to fail
There's some people that
You don't forget
Even though you've only seen 'em one time or two
When the roses fade
And I'm in the shade
I'll remember you

Didn't I, didn't I try to love you?
Didn't I, didn't I try to care?
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you
With the rain blowing in your hair?
I'll remember you
When the wind blows through the piney wood
It was you who came right through
It was you who understood
Though I'd never say
That I done it the way
That you'd have liked me to
In the end
My dear sweet friend
I'll remember you1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

High up on the housetops, high as I can see
Looking for them rounders, looking out for me
All the friends I ever had are gone

Judge says to Curtis, ""What's this noise about?""
""All about them rounders, Judge, tryin' to cut me out.""

Lenny Bruce,"Lenny Bruce is dead but his ghost lives on and on
Never did get any Golden Globe award, never made it to Synanon
He was an outlaw, that’s for sure
More of an outlaw than you ever were
Lenny Bruce is gone but his spirit’s livin’ on and on

Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn’t work out
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talkin’ about
Never robbed any churches nor cut off any babies’ heads
He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds
He’s on some other shore, he didn’t wanna live anymore

Lenny Bruce is dead but he didn’t commit any crime
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time
I rode with him in a taxi once
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months
Lenny Bruce moved on and like the ones that killed him, gone

They said that he was sick ’cause he didn’t play by the rules
He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts
He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
George Jackson,"I woke up this morning
There were tears in my bed
They killed a man I really loved
Shot him through the head
Lord, Lord, they cut George Jackson down
Lord, Lord, they laid him in the ground
Sent him off to prison
For a seventy dollar robbery
Closed the door behind him
And they threw away the key
Lord, Lord, they cut George Jackson down
Lord, Lord, they laid him in the ground
He wouldn't take shit from no one
He wouldn't bow down or kneel
Authorities, they hated him
Because he was just too real
Lord, Lord, they cut George Jackson down
Lord, Lord, they laid him in the ground
Prison guards, they cursed him
As they watched him from above
But they were frightened of his power
They were scared of his love
Lord, Lord, so they cut George Jackson down
Lord, Lord, they laid him in the ground
Sometimes I think this whole world
Is one big prison yard
Some of us are prisoners
The rest of us are guards
Lord, Lord, they cut George Jackson down

Stay with Me,"Should my heart not be humble
Should my eyes fail to see
Should my feet sometimes stumble
On the way, stay with me
Like the lamb that in springtime
Wanders far from the fold
Comes the darkness and the frost

I grow cold, I grow weary, and I know I have sinned
And I go seeking shelter and I cry in the wind
And though I grope and I blunder and I'm weak and I'm wrong
Though the road buckles under where I walk, walk along
Till I find to my wonder every path leads to thee
All that I can do is pray, stay with me
Stay with me1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

And I just can't wait
Wait for us to become friends

Well now what's the use in dreaming
You got better things to do
Dreams never did work for me anyway
Even when they did come true

Baby you could start a fire
I must be losing my mind
You're the object of my desire

I'm listening to Billy Joe Shaver
And I'm reading James Joyce
Some people they tell me
I got the blood of the land in my voice

Everybody got all the beautiful clothes
Everybody got all the flowers
I don't have one single rose

Where the wild birds do all
Their notes to increase

So I understand
She wants a freeholder
Who owns a house and land
I cannot maintain her
With silver and gold
And all of the fine things
That a big house can hold

And could write a fine hand
I'd write my love a letter
That she'd understand
And write it by the river
Where the waters overflow
But I dream of pretty Saro
Wherever I goEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Property of Jesus,"Go ahead and talk about him because he makes you doubt
Because he has denied himself the things that you can’t live without
Laugh at him behind his back just like the others do
Remind him of what he used to be when he comes walking through

He’s the property of Jesus
Resent him to the bone
You got something better
You’ve got a heart of stone

Stop your conversation when he passes on the street
Hope he falls upon himself, oh, won’t that be sweet
Because he can’t be exploited by superstition anymore
Because he can’t be bribed or bought by the things that you adore

He’s the property of Jesus
Resent him to the bone
You got something better
You’ve got a heart of stone

When the whip that’s keeping you in line doesn’t make him jump
Say he’s hard-of-hearing, say that he’s a chump
Say he’s out of step with reality as you try to test his nerve
Because he doesn’t pay no tribute to the king that you serve
He’s the property of Jesus
Resent him to the bone
You got something better
You’ve got a heart of stone

Say that he’s a loser ’cause he got no common sense
Because he don’t increase his worth at someone else’s expense
Because he’s not afraid of trying, ’cause he don’t look at you and smile
’Cause he doesn’t tell you jokes or fairy tales, say he’s got no style

He’s the property of Jesus
Resent him to the bone
You got something better
You’ve got a heart of stone

You can laugh at salvation, you can play Olympic games
You think that when you rest at last you’ll go back from where you came
But you’ve picked up quite a story and you’ve changed since the womb
What happened to the real you, you’ve been captured but by whom?

He’s the property of Jesus
Resent him to the bone
You got something better

"The Water is Wide  (Live at the Boston Music Hall, Boston, MA - November 21, 1975, Evening Show)","The water is wide and I can't cross over
Neither have I wings that I could fly
Build me a boat that can carry two
And both shall row my love and I

There is a ship and it sails on the sea
Loaded deep as deep can be
But not as deep as the love I'm in
I know not if I sink or swim

I leaned my back up against an oak
Thinking it was a trusty tree
But first it bent and then it broke
Just like my own false love to me

Oh love is gentle, love is kind
Gay as a jewel when first it's new
But love grows old and waxes cold
And fades away like some morning dew

The water is wide and I can't cross over
Neither have I wings that I could fly

We Better Talk This Over,"I think we better talk this over
Maybe when we both get sober

Why should we needlessly suffer?
Let’s call it a day, go our own different ways
Before we decay
You don’t have to be afraid of looking into my face
We’ve done nothing to each other time will not erase

I feel displaced, I got a low-down feeling
You been two-faced, you been double-dealing
I took a chance, got caught in the trance
Of a downhill dance

Oh, child, why you wanna hurt me?
I’m exiled, you can’t convert me
I’m lost in the haze of your delicate ways
With both eyes glazed
You don’t have to yearn for love, you don’t have to be alone
Somewheres in this universe there’s a place that you can call home

I guess I’ll be leaving tomorrow
If I have to beg, steal or borrow
It’d be great to cross paths in a day and a half
Look at each other and laugh

But I don’t think it’s liable to happen
Like the sound of one hand clapping’
The vows that we kept are now broken and swept
’Neath the bed where we slept

Don’t think of me and fantasize on what we never had
Be grateful for what we’ve shared together and be glad
Why should we go on watching each other through a telescope?
Eventually we’ll hang ourselves on all this tangled rope

Oh, babe, time for a new transition
I wish I was a magician
I would wave a wand and tie back the bond
That we’ve both gone beyondEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

’Cept you, yeah you

There’s a hymn I used to hear
In the churches all the time
Make me feel so good inside
So peaceful, so sublime
And there’s nothing to remind me of that
Old familiar chime
’Cept you, uh huh you
Used to play in the cemetery
Dance and sing and run when I was a child
Never seemed strange
But now I just pass mournfully by
That place where the bones of life are piled
I know something’ has changed
I’m a stranger here and no one sees me
’Cept you, yeah you

Nothing much matters or seems to please me
’Cept you, yeah you
Nothing hypnotizes me
Or holds me in a spell
Everything runs by me
Just like water from a well
Everybody wants my attention
Everybody’s got something to sell
’Cept you, yeah youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Tangled Up In Blue (Real Live version),"Early one morning the sun was shining
And he was laying in bed
Wondering if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red
Her folks they said that their lives together
Sure was gonna be rough
They never did like mama's home-made dress
Papa's bank book wasn't big enough
He was standing at the side of the road
Rain falling on his shoes
Heading out for the old East Coast
Radio blasting the news
Straight on through
Tangled up in blue

She was married when they first met
To a man four times her age
He left her penniless in a state of regret
It was time to bust out of the cage
And they drove that car as far as they could
Abandoned it out west
Splitting up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best
She turned around to look at him
As he was walking away
Saying ""I wish I could tell you all the things
That I never learned to say""
He said ""That's all right, baby, I love you too
But we were tangled up in blue""
He had a steady job and a pretty face
And everything seemed to fit
One day he could just feel the waste
He put it all down and split
And he drifted down to New Orleans
Where they treated him like a boy
He nearly went mad in Baton Rouge
He nearly drowned in Delacroix
But all the while he was alone
The past was close behind
He had one too many lovers and
None of them were too refined
All except for you
But you were tangled up in blue

She was working in the blinding light
And I stopped in for a drink
I just kept looking at her face so white
I didn't know what to think
Later on when the crowd thinned out
I was getting ready to leave
She was standing there right beside my chair
Saying ""What's that you got up your sleeve?""
I said ""Nothing baby, and that's for sure""
She leaned down into my face
I could feel the heat and the pulse of her
As she bent down to tie the laces
Of my shoe
Tangled up in blue
I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs
There was snow all winter and no heat
Revolution was in the air
And one day all of his slaves ran free
Something inside of him died
The only thing I could do was be me
And get on that train and ride
And when it all came crashing down
I was already south
I didn't know whether the world was flat or round
I had the worst taste in my mouth
That I ever knew
Tangled up in blue

So now I'm going on back again
Maybe tomorrow or maybe next year
I gotta find someone among the women and men
Whose destiny is unclear
Some are masters of illusion
Some are ministers of the trade
All of the strong delusion
All of their beds are unmade
Me I'm still heading towards the sun
Trying to stay out of the joint
We always did love the very same one
We just saw her from a different point
Of view
Tangled up in blueEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Precious Memories,"As I travel down life's pathway
Know not what the years may hold
As I ponder, hopes grow fonder
Precious memories flood my soul

Precious memories, how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold

Precious father, loving mother
Glide across the lonely years
And old homes scenes of my childhood
In fond memory appears

Precious memories, how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfoldEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Cocaine Blues,"Everytime my baby and me go up town
Police come and they knock me down
Cocaine, all around my brain
Hey baby, better come here quick
This old cocaine is making me sick
Cocaine, all around my brain
Yonder comes by baby, she's dressed in red
She's got a shot-gun, says she's gonna kill me dead
Cocaine, all around my brain
Hey baby, better come here quick
This old cocaine is making me sick
Cocaine, all around my brain
Early one morning, half past four
Cocaine came knockin' on my door
Cocaine, all around my brain
Hey baby, you better come here quick
This old cocaine is making me sick
Cocaine, all around my brain
Cocaine's for horses and it's not for men
Doctor said it kill you, but he don't say when
Cocaine, all around my brain
Hey baby, you better come here quick

’Twas in the town of Griffin
In the year of sixty-five
A well known famous drover
Stepped up to me and talked
Sayin’ ""How do you do, young cowboy
And how’d you like to go
Spend the summer pleasantly
In the hills of Mexico""
Well, me being out of work right then
To this drover I did say
""Well, this going out on the buffalo range
Depends on your pay
But if you pay good wages
Transportation to and fro
I think I might go with you
To the hills of Mexico""
Well, we crossed the ?? river, boys
Our troubles they begun
Lightening, flashlight, hell-fire
Had made the cattle run
I tread towards the hiding place
??
Comanches waiting to pick us off
On the hills of MexicoEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
The Night We Called It a Day,"There was a moon out in space
But a cloud drifted over its face
You kissed me and went on your way
The night we called it a day
I heard the song of the spheres
Like a minor lament in my ears
I hadn't the heart left to pray
The night we called it a day

Soft through the dark
The hoot of an owl in the sky
Sad though his song
No bluer than he was I
The moon went down, stars were gone
But the sun didn't rise with the dawn
There wasn't a thing left to say
The night we called it a day

Soft through the dark
The hoot of an owl in the sky
Sad though his song
No bluer than he was I
The moon went down, stars were gone
But the sun didn't rise with the dawn
There wasn't a thing left to say
The night we called it a dayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Are You Ready,"Are you ready, are you ready?
Are you ready, are you ready?

Are you ready to meet Jesus?
Are you where you ought to be?
Will He know you when He sees you
Or will He say, “Depart from Me”?

Are you ready, hope you’re ready
Am I ready, am I ready?
Am I ready, am I ready?

Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren
And to take up my cross?
Have I surrendered to the will of God
Or am I still acting like the boss?

Am I ready, hope I’m ready

When destruction cometh swiftly
And there’s no time to say a fare-thee-well
Have you decided whether you want to be
In heaven or in hell?
Are you ready, are you ready?

Have you got some unfinished business?
Is there something holding you back?
Are you thinking for yourself
Or are you following the pack?

Are you ready, hope you’re ready
Are you ready?
Are you ready for the judgment?
Are you ready for that terrible swift sword?
Are you ready for Armageddon?
Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
Are you ready, I hope you’re readyEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
I Can’t Get You Off Of My Mind,"Oh, I can't get you off of my mind

Lord, I've tried and I've tried, all night long I've cried
But I can't get you off of my mind

Tight Connection to My Heart (Has Anyone Seen My Love),"Well, I had to move fast
And I couldn’t with you around my neck
I said I’d send for you and I did
What did you expect?
My hands are sweating
And we haven’t even started yet
I’ll go along with the charade
Until I can think my way out
I know it was all a big joke
Whatever it was about
Someday maybe
I’ll remember to forget

I’m going to get my coat
I feel the breath of a storm
There’s something I’ve got to do tonight
You go inside and stay warm

Has anybody seen my love?
Has anybody seen my love?
Has anybody seen my love?
I don’t know
Has anybody seen my love?
You want to talk to me
Go ahead and talk
Whatever you got to say to me
Won’t come as any shock
I must be guilty of something
You just whisper it into my ear
Madame Butterfly
She lulled me to sleep
In a town without pity
Where the water runs deep
She said, “Be easy, baby
There is nothing worth stealing in here”

You’re the one I’ve been looking for
You’re the one that’s got the key
But I can’t figure out whether I’m too good for you
Or you’re too good for me

Has anybody seen my love?
Has anybody seen my love?
Has anybody seen my love?
I don’t know
Has anybody seen my love?
Well, they’re not showing any lights tonight
And there’s no moon
There’s just a hot-blooded singer
Singing “Memphis in June”
While they’re beating the devil out of a guy
Who’s wearing a powder-blue wig
Later he’ll be shot
For resisting arrest
I can still hear his voice crying
In the wilderness
What looks large from a distance
Close up is never that big

Never could learn to drink that blood
And call it wine
Never could learn to hold you, love
And call you mineEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Forgetful Heart,"Forgetful heart
Lost your power of recall
Every little detail
You don't remember at all
The times we knew
Who would remember better than you

Forgetful heart
We laughed and had a good time you and I
It's been so long
Now you're content to let the days go by
When you were there
You were the answer to my prayer

Forgetful heart
We loved with all the love that life can give
What can I say
Without you it's so hard to live
Can't take much more
Why can't we love like we did before

Forgetful heart
Like a walking shadow in my brain
All night long
I lay awake and listen to the sound of pain
The door has closed forevermore
If indeed there ever was a door1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
My Back Pages (Dylan 30th Anniversary),"Crimson flames tied through my ears
Rolling high and mighty traps
Pounced with fire on flaming roads
Using ideas as my maps
“We’ll meet on edges, soon,” said I
Proud 'neath heated brow

Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now

Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth
“Rip down all hate,” I screamed
Lies that life is black and white
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed
Romantic facts of musketeers
Foundationed deep, somehow

Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now

Girls’ faces formed the forward path
From phony jealousy
To memorizing politics
Of ancient history
Flung down by corpse evangelists
Un-thought of, though, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now


A self-ordained professor’s tongue
Too serious to fool
Spouted out that liberty
Is just equality in school
“Equality,” I spoke the word
As if a wedding vow

Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now

In a soldier’s stance, I aimed my hand
At the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not that I’d become my enemy
In the instant that I preach
My existence led by confusion boats
Mutiny from stern to bow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now

Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats
Too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking
I had something to protect
Good and bad, I define these terms
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow

Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now


Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Man on the Street (Studio Outtake - 1961),"Well I'll sing you a song, It ain't very long

At the man whose clothes 'n' shoes were torn
There on the sidewalk he did lay
They stopped 'n' stared 'n' walked their way

Well, the p'liceman come and he looked around
""Get up, old man, or I'm a-takin' you down.""
He jabbed him once with his billy club
And the old man then rolled off the curb

Well, he jabbed him again and loudly said
""Call the wagon, this man is dead""
The wagon come, they loaded him in

Under Your Spell,"Something’ about you that I can’t shake
Don’t know how much more of this I can take
Baby, I’m under your spell

I was knocked out and loaded in the naked night
When my last dream exploded, I noticed your light

It’s been nice seeing you, you read me like a book
If you ever want to reach me, you know where to look
Baby, I’ll be at the same hotel

I’d like to help you but I’m in a bit of a jam
I’ll call you tomorrow if there’s phones where I am
Baby, caught between heaven and hell
But I will be back, I will survive
You’ll never get rid of me as long as you’re alive
Baby, can’t you tell

Well it’s four in the morning by the sound of the birds
I’m staring’ at your picture, I’m hearing’ your words
Baby, they ring in my head like a bell
Everywhere you go it’s enough to break hearts
Someone always gets hurt, a fire always starts
You were too hot to handle, you were breaking every vow
I trusted your baby, you can trust me now

Turn back baby, wipe your eye
Don’t think I’m leaving here without a kiss goodbye
Baby, is there anything left to tell?
I’ll see you later when I’m not so out of my head
Maybe next time I’ll let the dead bury the dead
Baby, what more can I tell?

Well the desert is hot, the mountain is cursed
Pray that I don’t die of thirst

One day the little boy and the little girl were both baked in a pie
Let the wind blow low, let the wind blow high

As Time Goes By,"You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is still just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by
And when two lovers woo
They still say ""I love you""
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by
Moonlight and love songs never out of date
Hearts full of passion, jealousy, and hate
Woman needs man and man must have his mate
That no one can deny
It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes byEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Cantina Theme (Workin’ For The Law),
Three Angels,"Three angels up above the street
Each one playing a horn
Dressed in green robes with wings that stick out
They’ve been there since Christmas morn
The wildest cat from Montana passes by in a flash
Then a lady in a bright orange dress
One U-Haul trailer, a truck with no wheels
The Tenth Avenue bus going west
The dogs and pigeons fly up and they flutter around
A man with a badge skips by
Three fellas crawling on their way back to work
Nobody stops to ask why
The bakery truck stops outside of that fence
Where the angels stand high on their poles
The driver peeks out, trying to find one face
In this concrete world full of souls
The angels play on their horns all day
The whole earth in progression seems to pass by
But does anyone hear the music they play
Does anyone even try?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Winterlude, Winterlude, my little apple
Winterlude by the corn in the field
Winterlude, let’s go down to the chapel
Then come back and cook up a meal
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens
By the sun, near the old crossroads sign
The snow is so cold, but our love can be bold
Winterlude, don’t be rude, please be mine

Winterlude, Winterlude, my little daisy
Winterlude by the telephone wire
Winterlude, it’s making me lazy
Come on, sit by the logs in the fire
The moonlight reflects from the window
Where the snowflakes, they cover the sand
Come out tonight, everything will be tight
Winterlude, this dude thinks you’re grandEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

But that's not for me, cause I can't see
My kind of crazy world go passing me by

To share a kiss that the devil has known

Barbara Allen,"'Twas in the merry month of May
When green buds all were swelling
Sweet William on his death bed lay
For love of Barbara Allen
He sent his servant to the town
To the place where she was dwelling
Saying you must come, to my master dear
If your name be Barbara Allen
So slowly, slowly she got up
And slowly she drew nigh him
And the only words to him did say
""Young man, I think you're dying""
He turned his face unto the wall
And death was in him welling
Goodbye, goodbye, to my friends all
Be good to Barbara Allen
When he was dead and laid in grave
She heard the death bells knelling
And every stroke to her did say
Hard-hearted Barbara Allen
Oh mother, oh mother go dig my grave
Make it both long and narrow
Sweet William died of love for me
And I will die of sorrow
And father, oh father, go dig my grave
Make it both long and narrow
Sweet William died on yesterday
And I will die tomorrow
Barbara Allen was buried in the old churchyard
Sweet William was buried beside her
Out of sweet William's heart, there grew a rose
Out of Barbara Allen's a briar
They grew and grew in the old churchyard
Till they could grow no higher
At the end they formed, a true lover's knot
And the rose grew round the briarEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
A Satisfied Mind,"How many times have you heard someone say
If I had his money I'd do things my way
Hmm, but little they know
Hmm, it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind

Hmm, once I was wading in fortune and fame
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in life’s game
But suddenly it happened
Hmm, I lost every dime
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind

Hmm, when my life is over and my time has run out
My friends and my love ones
I'll leave there's no doubt
But one thing for certain
When it comes my time
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mindEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
What Can I Do for You?,"You have given everything to me
What can I do for You?
You have given me eyes to see
What can I do for You?

Pulled me out of bondage and You made me renewed inside
Filled up a hunger that had always been denied
Opened up a door no man can shut and You opened it up so wide
And You’ve chosen me to be among the few
What can I do for You?

You have laid down Your life for me
What can I do for You?
You have explained every mystery
What can I do for You?

Soon as a man is born, you know the sparks begin to fly
He gets wise in his own eyes and he’s made to believe a lie
Who would deliver him from the death he’s bound to die?
Well, You’ve done it all and there’s no more anyone can pretend to do
What can I do for You?
You have given all there is to give
What can I do for You?
You have given me life to live
How can I live for You?

I know all about poison, I know all about fiery darts
I don’t care how rough the road is, show me where it starts
Whatever pleases You, tell it to my heart
Well, I don’t deserve it but I sure did make it through
What can I do for You?1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Only a Hobo,"As I was out walking on a corner one day
I spied an old hobo, in a doorway he lay
His face was all grounded in the cold sidewalk floor
And I guess he’d been there for the whole night or more

Only a hobo, but one more is gone
Leaving nobody to sing his sad song
Leaving nobody to carry him home
Only a hobo, but one more is gone

A blanket of newspaper covered his head
As the curb was his pillow, the street was his bed
One look at his face showed the hard road he’d come
And a fistful of coins showed the money he bummed


Does it take much of a man to see his whole life go down
To look up on the world from a hole in the ground
To wait for your future like a horse that’s gone lame
To lie in the gutter and die with no name?

She answered to him with a lovin' smile

It’s All Good,"Talk about me babe, if you must
Throw on the dirt, pile on the dust
I'd do the same thing if I could
You know what they say, they say it's all good
All good
It's all good

Big politician telling lies
Restaurant kitchen, all full of flies
Don't make a bit of difference, don't see why it should
But it's all right, 'cause it's all good
It's all good
It's all good

Wives are leaving'their husbands, they are beginning to roam
They leave the party and they never get home
I wouldn't change it, even if I could
You know what they say man, it's all good
It's all good
All good

Brick by brick, they tear you down
A teacup of water is enough to drown
You ought to know, if they could they would
Whatever going down, it's all good
All good
Say it's all good
People in the country, people on the land
Some of them so sick, they can hardly stand
Everybody would move away, if they could
It's hard to believe but it's all good
Yeah

The widow's cry, the orphan's plea
Everywhere you look, more misery
Come along with me, babe, I wish you would
You know what I'm saying, it's all good
All good
I said it's all good
All good
[Verse 7}
Cold-blooded killer, stalking the town
Cop cars blinking, something bad going down
Buildings are crumbling in the neighborhood
But there's nothing to worry about, because it's all good
It's all good
They say it's all good

I'll pluck off your beard and blow it in your face
This time tomorrow I'll be rolling in your place
I wouldn't change a thing even if I could
You know what they say, they say it's all good
It's all goodEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Angelina,"Well, it’s always been my nature to take chances
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances
To the tune of a concertina

Blood dryin’ in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door
But whatever could it be, makes you think you’ve seen me before
Angelina

Oh, Angelina
Oh, Angelina

His eyes were two slits make any snake proud
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
Worshipping a god with the body of a woman well endowed
And the head of a hyena

Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek
Angelina
Oh, Angelina
Oh, Angelina

In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode
The peaches they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed
I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road
With your subpoena

When you cease to exist, then who will you blame
I’ve tried my best to love you but I cannot play this game
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same
Angelina

Oh, Angelina
Oh, Angelina

There’s a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone
Your servants are half dead, you’re down to the bone
Tell me, tall men, where would you like to be overthrown
Maybe down in Jerusalem or Argentina?
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old
Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold
He’s surrounded by God’s angels and she’s wearing’ a blindfold
And so are you, Angelina

Oh, Angelina
Oh, Angelina

I see pieces of men marching; trying to take heaven by force
I can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse
In God’s truth tell me what you want and you’ll have it of course
Just step into the arena

Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases
Pass the tree of smoke, pass the angel with four faces
Begging God for mercy and weeping’ in unholy places
Angelina

Oh, Angelina
Oh, Angelina1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
The Sound of Silence,"Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence
In restless dreams I walk alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence
And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dared
Disturb the sound of silence
""Fools"" said I,""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you.""
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed
In the wells of silence
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the signs said, 'The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whisper'd in the sounds of silenceEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Long Time Gone,"My parents raised me tenderly
I was their only son
My mind got mixed with rambling
When I was all so young
And I left my home the first time
When I was twelve and one
I’m a long time a-comin’, Maw
An’ I’ll be a long time gone

On the western side of Texas
On the Texas plains
I tried to find a job o’ work
But they said l’s young of age
My eyes they burned when I heard
“Go home where you belong!”
I’m a long time a-comin’
An’ I’ll be a long time gone

I remember when I’s rambling
Around with the carnival trains
Different towns, different people
Somehow they’re all the same
I remember children’s faces best
I remember traveling on
I’m a long time a-comin’
I’ll be a long time gone
I once loved a fair young maid
An’ I ain’t too big to tell
If she broke my heart a single time
She broke it ten or twelve
I walked and talked all by myself
I did not tell no one
I’m a long time a-comin’, babe
An’ I’ll be a long time gone

Many times by the highwayside
I tried to flag a ride
With bloodshot eyes and gritting teeth
I’d watch the cars roll by
The empty air hung in my head
I’s thinkin’ all day long
I’m a long time a-comin’
I’ll be a long time gone

You might see me on your crossroads
When I’m a-passin’ through
Remember me how you wished to
As I’m a-Driftin’ from your view
I ain’t got the time to think about it
I got too much to get done
Well, I’m a long time coming
An’ I’ll be a long time gone
If I can’t help somebody
With a word or song
If I can’t show somebody
They are traveling’ wrong
But I know I ain’t no prophet
An’ I ain’t no prophet’s son
I’m just a long time a-comin’
An’ I’ll be a long time gone

So you can have your beauty
It’s skin deep and it only lies
And you can have your youth
It’ll rot before your eyes
Just give to me my gravestone
With it clearly carved upon:
“I’s a long time a-comin’
An’ I’ll be a long time gone”EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Big Yellow Taxi,"They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
A pink hotel, a boutique and a swinging hot spot
Don't it always go to show
You never know what you got till it's gone ?
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot

They took all the trees, they put them in a tree museum
They charged the people a dollar and a half just to see them
Don't it always go to show
You never know what you got till it's gone ?
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot

Hey farmer, farmer, put away that D.D.T
Give me spots on my apples but leave me the birds and the bees, please
Don't it always go to show
You never know what you got till it's gone ?
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot

Late last night I heard my screen door slam
A big yellow bulldozer took away my house and land
Don't it always go to show
You never know what you got till it's gone ?
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Early Mornin’ Rain,"In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go

Cut on runway number nine, big 707 set to go
I'm stuck here on the ground, where the cold winds blow
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast
There she goes, my friend, she's rolling down at last

Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high
She's away and westward bound, far above the clouds she'll fly
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours time

This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
Because I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunks as I might be
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train
So I'd best be on my way in the early morning rainEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

For making your prayers known

I’ve been broken, shattered like an empty cup
I’m just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up
And I know He will do it ’cause He’s faithful and He’s true
He must have loved me so much to send me someone as fine as you

Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world
You know we are strangers in a land we’re passing through
I’ll always be right by your side, I’ve got a covenant too

Ballad for a Friend (Witmark Demo - 1962),"Sad I’m a-sittin’ on the railroad track
Watching’ that old smokestack
Train is a-leavin’ but it won’t be back

Years ago we hang around
Watching’ trains roll through the town
Now that train is a-graveyard bound

Where we go up in that North Country
Lakes and streams and mines so free
I had no better friend than he

Something happened to him that day
I thought I heard a stranger say
I hung my head and stole away

A diesel truck was headin’ down
Carryin' up a heavy load
Left him on a Utah road

They carried him back to his hometown
His mother cried, his sister moaned
Listening’ to them church bells tone
A diesel truck was rollin' slow
Pullin' down a heavy load
It left him on a Utah road

I-I sung the last verse for ya because I missed the words the first time I sung them about the truckEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Someone’s Got a Hold of My Heart,"They say, “Eat, drink and be merry
Take the bull by the horns”
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns
Everything looks a little far away to me

Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap
Too much information about nothing
Too much educated rap
It’s just like you told me, just like you said it would be

The moon rising like wildfire
I feel the breath of a storm
Something I got to do tonight
You go inside and stay warm

Someone’s got a hold of my heart
Someone’s got a hold of my heart
Someone’s got a hold of my heart
You
Yeah, you got a hold of my heart

Just got back from a city of flaming red skies
Everybody thinks with their stomach
There’s plenty of spies
Every street is crooked, they just wind around till they disappear
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
Like an ancient river
So wide and deep
She said, “Be easy, baby, ain’t nothin’ worth stealing in here”

You’re the one I’ve been waiting for
You’re the one I desire
But you must first realize
I’m not another man for hire


I can hear that hot-blooded singer
On the bandstand croon
Poisoned Love, Red Roses for a Blue Lady and Memphis in June
While they’re beating the devil out of a guy who’s wearing a powder blue wig

I been to Babylon
I gotta confess
I could still hear the voice crying in the wilderness
What looks large from a distance, close up is never that big
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine

The night that I sailed away
Oh, trade winds, what are vows that lovers make?
Oh, trade winds, are they only made to break?
When it is May again
I’ll sail away again
Though I am returning it won’t be the same

Yes, this woman I’ve got, she’s thrilling me with her hive
She’s calling me Stan
Or else she calls me Mister Clive

I know you’re gonna think this song is a cliff
Unless you’ve been inside a tunnel
And fell down 69, 70 feet over a barbed-wire fence

But I forgot more than you'll ever know about her

You didn't care how it hurt me
But you can never steal away memories of what used to be

You think she's yours, to have and to hold
Someday you'll learn, when her love grows cold

House Carpenter,"Well met, well met, my own true love
Well met, well met, cried she
I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
And it's all for the love of thee

I could have married a King's daughter there
She would have married me
But I have forsaken my King's daughter there
It's all for the love of thee

Well, if you could have married a King's daughter there
I'm sure you're the one to blame
For I am married to a house carpenter
And I'm sure he's a fine young man

Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
And come away with me
I'll take you where the green grass grows
On the shores of sunny Italy

So up she picked her babies three
And gave them kisses, one, two, three
Saying ""take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
And keep him good company.""
Well, they were sailing about two weeks
I'm sure it was not three
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck
Saying she wants company

""Well, are you weeping for your house and home?
Or are you weeping for your babies three?""
""Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter
I'm weeping for my babies three.""

There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
'Cause that old feeling is still in my heart
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
'Cause that old feeling is still in my heartEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Huck’s Tune,"Well I wandered alone through a desert of stone
And I dreamt of my future wife
My sword's in my hand and I'm next in command
In this version of death called life
My plate and my cup are right straight up
I took a rose from the hand of a child
When I kiss your lips, the honey drips
But I'm gonna have to put you down for a while

Every day we meet on any old street
And you're in your girlish prime
The short and the tall are coming to the ball
I go there all the time
Behind every tree, there's something to see
The river is wider than a mile
I tried you twice, you can't be nice
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while

Here come the nurse with money in her purse
Here come the ladies and men
You push it all in and you've no chance to win
You play 'em on down to the end
I'm laying in the sand getting a sunshine tan
Moving along riding in style
From my toes to my head, you knock me dead
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while
I count the years and I shed no tears
I'm blinded to what might have been
Nature's voice makes my heart rejoice
Play me the wild song of the wind
I found hopeless love in the room above
When the sun and the weather were mild
You're as fine as wine, I ain't handing you no line
But I'm gonna have to put you down for a while

All the merry little elves can go hang themselves
My faith is as cold as can be
I'm stacked high to the roof and I'm not without proof
If you don't believe me, come see
You think I'm blue, I think so too
In my words, you'll find no guile
The game's gotten old, the deck's gone cold
And I'm gonna have to put you down for a while

The game's gotten old, the deck's gone cold
I'm gonna have to put you down for a whileEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
I Wanna Be Your Lover,"Well, the rainman comes with his magic wand
And the judge says, “Mona can’t have no bond”
And the walls collide, Mona cries
And the rainman leaves in the Wolfman’s disguise

I want to be your lover, baby, I want to be your man
I want to be your lover, baby
I don’t want to be hers, I want to be yours

Well, the undertaker in his midnight suit
Says to the masked man, “Ain’t you cute!”
Well, the mask man he gets up on the shelf
And he says, “You ain’t so bad yourself”


Well, jumping Judy can’t go no higher
She had bullets in her eyes, and they fire
Rasputin he’s so dignified
He touched the back of her head an’ he died

Well, Phaedra with her looking glass
Stretching out upon the grass
She gets all messed up and she faints
That’s ’cause she’s so obvious and you ain’t

My Wife’s Home Town,"Well I didn't come here to deal with a dog gone thing
I just came here to hear the drummer's cymbal ring
There is no way you can put me down
I just want to say that Hell's my wife's home town

Well there's reasons for that and reasons for this
I can't think of any just now, but I know they exist
I'm sitting in the sun till my skin turns brown
I just want to say that Hell's my wife's home town
Home town, home town

She can make you steal, make you rob
Give you the hives, make you lose your job
Make things bad, she can make things worse
She got stuff more potent than a gypsy curse

One of these days, I'll end up on the run
I'm pretty sure, she'll make me kill someone
I'm going inside, roll the shutters down
I just want to say that Hell's my wife's home town

Well there's plenty to remember, plenty to forget
I still can remember the day we met
I lost my reason long ago
My love for her is all I know
State gone broke, the county's dry
Don't be looking at me, with that evil eye
Keep on walking don't be hanging around
I'm telling you again that Hell's my wife's home town
Home town, home town1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Some Enchanted Evening,"Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger
You may see a stranger across a crowded room
And somehow you knew, you know even then
That somehow you'll see her again and again
Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room
And night after night, as strange as it seems
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams
Who can explain it, who can tell you why?
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try
Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love
When you feel her call you across a crowded room
Then fly to her side and make her your own
Or all through your life you may dream all alone
Once that you found her, never let her go
Once you have found her, never let her goEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
In the Summertime,"I was in your presence for an hour or so
Or was it a day? I truly don't know
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low
By that soft and shining sea
Did you respect me for what I did
Or for what I didn't do, or for keeping it hid?
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid
Of everything you see?

In the summertime, ah in the summertime
In the summertime, when you were with me

I got the heart and you got the blood
We cut through iron and we cut through mud
Then came the warning that was before the flood
That set everybody free
Fools they made a mock of sin
Our loyalty they tried to win
But you were closer to me than my next of kin
When they didn't want to know or see

In the summertime, ah in the summertime
In the summertime, when you were with me
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs
Poverty and shame was theirs
But all that suffering was not to be compared
With the glory that is to be
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave
It's a part of me now, it’s been cherished and saved
It'll be with me unto the grave
And then unto eternity

In the summertime, ah in the summertime
In the summertime, when you were with meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
It Gets Lonely Early,"When you're all alone
All the children grown
And, like starlings, flown away
It gets lonely early, doesn't it?
Lonely early, doesn't it?
Ev'ry single endless day
When your twilight nears
And one face appears
Turning winter years to May
It gets lonely early, doesn't it?
Lonely early, doesn't it?
Still the old heart's young enough to say
""It was really more than lovely, wasn't it?
""Truly lovely, wasn't it?""

I'm going to take a trip on the big McMillan

The Captain has gone through the hole-in-the-wall

The engine give a crack and the whistle gave a squall

Suze (The Cough Song),
Hard Times,"Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
While we all sup sorrow with the poor
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears
Oh, hard times, come again no more
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Oh, hard times, come again no more
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay
There are frail forms fainting at the door
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say
Oh, hard times, come again no more
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door
Oh, hard times, come again no more
There's pale drooping maiden who toils her life away
With a worn out heart, whose better days are o'er
Though her voice it would be merry, 'tis sighing all the day
Oh, hard times, come again no more
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary
Hard times, hard times, come again no more
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door

The Christmas Song,"All through the year we waited
Waited through spring and fall
To hear silver bells ringing
See winter time bringing
The happiest season of all

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos

Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny little tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways

Diamond Joe,"Now There's a man you'll hear about
Most anywhere you go
And his holdings are in Texas
And his name is Diamond Joe

And he carries all his money
In a diamond-studded jar
He never took much trouble
With the process of the law

I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys
Did offer him my hand
He gave me a string of horses
So old they could not stand

And I nearly starved to death, boys
He did mistreat me so
And I never saved a dollar
In the pay of Diamond Joe

Now his bread it was corn dodger
And his meat you couldn't chaw
Nearly drove me crazy
With the wagging of his jaw
And the telling of his story
Mean to let you know
That there never was a rounder
That could lie like Diamond Joe


Now, I tried three times to quit him
But he did argue so
I'm still punching cattle
In the pay of Diamond Joe

And when I'm called up yonder
And it's my time to go
Give my blankets to my buddies
Give the fleas to Diamond Joe1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
"Tangled Up in Blue (9/19/74, Take 3, Remake 3)","Early one morning the sun was shining
And he was laying in bed
Wondering if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red
Her folks they said their lives together
Sure was going to be rough
They never did like Mama's homemade dress
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
And he was standing on the side of the road
Rain falling on his shoes
Heading out for the Old East Coast
Lord knows he's paid some dues
Getting through
Tangled up in blue

She was married when they first met
Soon to be divorced
He helped her out of a jam, I guess
But he used a little too much force
And they drove that car as far as they could
Abandoned it out West
And split up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best
And she turned around to look at him
As he was walking away
She said ""This can't be the end
We'll meet on another day, on the avenue""
Tangled up in blue
He had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But he never liked it all that much
And one day the ax just fell
So he drifted down to L.A
Where he reckoned to try his luck
Working for a while in an airplane plant
Loading cargo onto a truck
But all the while he was alone
The past was close behind
He seen a lot of women
But she never escaped his mind
And he just grew
Tangled up in blue

She was working in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer
I just kept looking at the side of her face
In the spotlight, so clear
And later on, when the crowd thinned out
I was about to do the same
She was standing there, in back of my chair
Said to me ""What's your name?""
I muttered something underneath my breath
She studied the lines on my face
I must admit, I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces
Of my shoes
Tangled up in blue
She lit a burner on the stove
And offered me a pipe
""I thought you'd never say hello"" she said
""You look like the silent type""
Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century
And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burning coal
Pouring off of every page
Like it was written in my soul
From me to you
Tangled up in blue

He was always in a hurry
Too busy or too stoned
And everything that she ever planned
Just had to be postponed
He thought they were successful
She thought they were blessed
With objects and material things
But I never was impressed
And when it all came crashing down
I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do
Was keep on keepin' on like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue
So now I'm going back again
I got to get to her somehow
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now
Some are mathematicians
Some are doctor's wives
Don't know how it all got started
Don't know what they're doing with their lives
But me, I'm still on the road
Heading for another joint
We always did feel the same
We just saw it from a different point
Of view
Tangled up in blueEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Santa Fé,"Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe
My woman needs it everyday
She promised this a-lad she’d stay
She’s rolling up a lotta bread to toss away

She’s in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe
Now she’s opened up an old maid’s home
She’s proud, but she needs to roam
She’s gonna write herself a roadside poem about Santa Fe

Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe
Since I’m never gonna cease to roam
I’m never, ever far from home
But I’ll build a geodesic dome and sail away

Don’t feel bad, no, no, no, no, don’t feel bad
It’s the best food I’ve ever had
Makes me feel so glad
That she’s cooking in a homemade pad
She never caught a cold so bad when I’m away

Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe
My shrimp boat’s in the bay
I won’t have my nature this way
And I’m leaning on the wheel each day to drift away from
Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe
My sister looks good at home
She’s licking on an ice cream cone
She’s packin’ her big white comb
What does it weigh?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
This Dream of You,"How long can I stay in this nowhere café
Before night turns into day
I wonder why I'm so frightened of dawn
All I have and all I know
Is this dream of you
Which keeps me living on

There's a moment when all old things
Become new again
But that moment might have come and gone
All I have and all I know
Is this dream of you
Which keeps me living on

I look away, but I keep seeing it
I don't want to believe, but I keep believing it
Shadows dance upon the wall
Shadows that seem to know it all

Am I too blind to see, is my heart playing tricks on me
I'm lost in the crowd
All my tears are gone
All I have and all I know
Is this dream of you
Which keeps me living on
Everything I touch seems to disappear
Everywhere I turn you are always here
I'll run this race until my earthly death
I'll defend this place with my dying breath

From a cheerless room in a curtained gloom
I saw a star from heaven fall
I turned and looked again but it was gone
All I have and all I know
Is this dream of you
Which keeps me living on1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
All the Way,"When somebody loves you
It's no good unless he loves you all the way
Happy to be near you
When you need someone to cheer you all the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue sea is
That's how deep it goes if it's real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless she needs you all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all those in-between years come what may

Who knows where the road will lead us
Only a fool would say
But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you all the way, all the way

And when somebody needs you

Imagination,"Imagination is funny
It makes a cloudy day sunny
It makes a bee think of honey
Just as I think of you
Imagination is crazy
Your whole perspective gets hazy
Starts you asking a daisy
What to do, what to do
Have you ever felt a gentle touch
And then a kiss, and then and then
Find it's only your imagination again
Imagination is silly
You go around willy nilly
For example I go around wanting you
And yet I can't imagine that you want me tooEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Hiding Too Long,"Come you phoney super patriotic people that say
That hatin' and fearing is my only way
That this here country has got to be
You're thinkin' of yourselves, you ain't thinkin' of me
You're not thinkin' of any George Washington
You're not thinkin' of any Thomas Jefferson
But you say that you are and you lie and mislead
You use their names for aims, for your selfish greed
Don't speak to me of your patriotism
When you throw the Southern black boy in prison
An' you say that the only good niggers are the ones that have died
Don't think I'll ever stand on your side
Though you make it so hard for me to love
My face will never feel the slap of your glove
My cards will never buy..
My hands will never buy the cards that you play
My feet will never walk down the road that you lay
Get out in the open, stop standin' afar
Let the whole world see what a hypocrit you are
I ain't jokin' and it ain't no gag
You bin hidin' too long behind the American flagEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Maybe Someday,"Maybe someday you’ll be satisfied
When you’ve lost everything you’ll have nothing left to hide
When you’re through running over things like you’re walking ’across the tracks
Maybe you’ll beg me to take you back
Maybe someday you’ll find out everybody’s somebody’s fool
Maybe then you’ll realize what it would have taken to keep me cool
Maybe someday when you’re by yourself alone
You’ll know the love that I had for you have been never my own

Maybe someday you’ll have nowhere to turn
You’ll look back and wonder ’bout the bridges you have burned
You’ll look back sometime when the lights grow dim
And you’ll see you look much better with me than you do with him
Through hostile cities and unfriendly towns
Thirty pieces of silver, no money down
Maybe someday, you will understand
That something for nothing is everybody’s plan

Maybe someday you’ll remember what you felt
When there was blood on the moon in the cotton belt
When both of us, baby, we're going through some sort of a test
Neither one of us could do what we do best
I should have known better, baby, I should have called your bluff
I guess I was too off the handle, not sentimental enough
Maybe someday, you’ll believe me when I say
That I wanted you, baby, in every kind of way
Maybe someday you’ll hear a voice from on high
Saying’, “For whose sake did you live, for whose sake did you die?”
Forgive me, baby, for what I didn’t do
For not breaking down no bedroom door to get at you
Always was a sucker for the right cross
Never wanted to go home ’till the last cent was lost
Maybe someday you will look back and see
That I made it so easy for you to follow me

Maybe someday there’ll be nothing to tell
I’m just as happy as you, baby, I just can’t say it so well
Never slumbered or slept or waited for lightning to strike
There’s no excuse for you to say that we don’t think alike
You said you were going’ to Frisco, stay a couple of months
I always like San Francisco, I was there for a party once
Maybe someday you’ll see that it’s true
There was no greater love than what I had for youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Jim Jones,"Come and listen for a moment, lads
And hear me tell my tale
How across the sea from England
I was condemned to sail
Now the jury found me guilty
Then says the judge, says he
""Oh, for life, Jim Jones, I'm sending you
Across the stormy sea
But take a tip before you ship
To join the iron gang
Don't get too gay in Botany Bay
Or else you'll surely hang
Or else you'll surely hang,"" says he
""And after that, Jim Jones
It's high above on the gallows tree
The crows will pick your bones.""

And our ship was high upon the sea
Then pirates came along
But the soldiers on our convict ship
Were full five hundred strong
For they opened fire and somehow drove
That pirate ship away
But I'd rather have joined that pirate ship
Than gone to Botany Bay
With the storms ragin' round us
And the winds a-blowin' gale
I'd rather have drowned in misery
Than gone to New South Wales
Now it's day and night and the irons clang
And like poor galley slaves
We toil and toil, and when we die
Must fill dishonored graves
And it's by and by I'll slip my chains
Well, into the bush I'll go
And I'll join the bush rangers there
Jack Donohue and co
And some dark night, when everything
Is silent in the town
I'll shoot those tyrants one and all
I'll gun the flogger down
Oh, I'll give the law
A little shock
Remember what I say
And they'll yet regret they've sent Jim Jones
In chains to Botany Bay1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Arthur McBride,"Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride
As we went a-walking down by the seaside
Now mark what followed and what did betide
For it being on Christmas morning

Now, for recreation, we went on a tramp
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
And a little wee drummer intending to camp
For the day being pleasant and charming

""Good morning, good morning,"" the Sergeant he cried
""And the same to you, gentlemen,"" we did reply
Intending no harm but meant to pass by
For it being on Christmas morning

""But,"" says he, ""My fine fellows, if you will enlist
Ten guineas in gold I'll stick in your fist
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust
And drink the king's health in the morning

For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
And he always is blessed with a charming young wife
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife
And he always lives pleasant and charming
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean
And sup on thin gruel in the morning.""


""But,"" says Arthur, ""I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
For you've only the lend of them, as I suppose
But you dare not change them one night, for you know
If you do, you'll be flogged in the morning

And although that we're single and free
We take great delight in our own company
We have no desire strange places to see
Although that your offers are charming

And we have no desire to take your advance
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France
Where we would get shot without warning.""
""Oh no,"" says the Sergeant. ""I'll have no such chat
And neither will I take it from snappy young brats
For if you insult me with one other word
I'll cut off your heads in the morning.""

And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs
And we scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head
And bid them take that as fair warning

And their old rusty rapiers that hung by their sides
We flung them as far as we could in the tide
""Now take them up, devils!"" cried Arthur McBride
""And temper their edge in the morning!""

And the little wee drummer, we flattened his bow
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll
And bade it a tedious returning

And we having no money, paid them off in cracks
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks
And left them for dead in the morning
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
For we were the lads who would give them hard clouts
And bid them look sharp in the morning


Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride
As we went a-walking down by the seaside
Now mark what followed and what did betide
For it being on Christmas morning1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
They Killed Him,"There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi

And made the bells of freedom ring today

He healed the lame and fed the hungry
And for his love they took his life away
On the road to glory where the story never ends

When the World Was Young,"It isn't by chance I happen to be

""Come sit over here"" somebody will call
""A drink for M'sieur, a drink for us all""

Ah, the apple trees
Blossoms in the breeze
That we walked among
Lyin' in the hay
Games we used to play
While the rounds were sung
Only yesterday, when the world was young
Wherever I go they mention my name
And that in itself, is some sort of fame
""Come by for a drink, we're havin' a game""
Wherever I go I'm glad that I came
The talk is quite gay, the company fine
There's laughter and lights, and glamour and wine
And beautiful girls and some of 'em mine
But often my eyes see a different shine
Ah, the apple trees
Sunlit memories
Where the hammock swung
On our backs we'd lie
Looking at the sky
'Til the stars were strung
Only last July when the world was youngEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
It Hurts Me Too,"So run here baby, put your little hands in mine
I've got something to tell you
I know you're gonna change your mind
When things go wrong, so wrong with you
It hurts me too

I want you, baby, just to understand
I don't wanna be your boss, babe
I just wanna be your man
When things go wrong, so wrong with you
It hurts me too

Now when you go home, you don't have to get along
Come back to me, baby
Where I live, that's where you belong
When things go wrong, so wrong with you
It hurts me too

I love you baby, and you know that it's true
I wouldn't mistreat you, baby
Nothing in this world is like you
When things go wrong, so wrong with you
It hurts me too
Yes, when things go wrong, so wrong with you
It hurts me too
So run here baby, put your little hand in mine
I got something to tell you, baby
I know that will change your mind
When things go wrong, so wrong with you
Don't you know it, don't you know it hurts me tooEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Johnny Todd,"Johnny Todd he took a notion
For to cross the ocean wide
And he left his love behind him
Walkin' down by the Liverpool tide
For a week she wept full sorrows
Tore her hair and wrung her hands
Till she met another sailor
Walkin' down by the Liverpool sands
Why fair maid are you a-weeping
For your Johnny gone to sea?
If you wed with me tomorrow
I'll be by you constantly
I will buy you clothes and blankets
I'll buy you a wedding ring
You shall have a gilded cradle
For to rock you baby in
Johnny Todd came home from sailin'
Sailin' on that ocean wide
And he found his fair and false one
Was another sailor's bride
Now, all you men who go a-sailing
For to fight the foreign foe
Never leave, never leave love like Johnny
Marry her before you goEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Tight Connection To My Heart,"Well, I had to move fast
And I couldn't with you around my neck
I said I'd send for you and I did
What did you expect?
My hands are sweating
And we haven't even started yet
I'll go along with the charade
Until I can think my way out
I know it was all a big joke
Whatever it was about
Someday maybe
I'll remember to forget
I'm gonna get my coat
I feel the breath of a storm
There's something I've got to do tonight
You go inside and stay warm
Has anybody seen my love
Has anybody seen my love
Has anybody seen my love
I don't know
Has anybody seen my love?
You want to talk to me
Go ahead and talk
Whatever you got to say to me
Won't come as any shock
I must be guilty of something
You just whisper it into my ear
Madame Butterfly
She lulled me to sleep
In a town without pity
Where the water runs deep
She said, ""Be easy, baby
There ain't nothin' worth stealin' in here.""
You're the one I've been looking for
You're the one that's got the key
But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you
Or you're too good for me
Has anybody seen my love
Has anybody seen my love
Has anybody seen my love
I don't know
Has anybody seen my love?
Well, they're not showing any lights tonight
And there's no moon
There's just a hot-blooded singer
Singing ""Memphis in June,""
While they're beatin' the devil out of a guy
Who's wearing a powder-blue wig
Later he'll be shot
For resisting arrest
I can still hear his voice crying
In the wilderness
What looks large from a distance
Close up ain't never that big
Never could learn to drink that blood
And call it wine
Never could learn to hold you, love
And call you mineEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
If You Ever Go to Houston,"If you ever go to Houston
Better walk right
Keep your hands in your pockets
And your gun-belt tight

If you're looking for a fight

Boy, you better walk right

If you're ever down there
On Bagby and Lamar
You better watch out for
The man with the shining star
Better know where you're going
Or stay where you are
If you're ever down there
On Bagby and Lamar

I know these streets
I've been here before
I nearly got killed here
During the Mexican war
Something always
Keeps me coming back for more
I know these streets
I've been here before
If you ever go to Dallas
Say hello to Mary Anne
Say I'm still pulling on the trigger
Hanging on the best I can
If you see her sister Lucy
Say I'm sorry I'm not there
Tell her other sister Betsy
To pray the sinner's prayer

I got a restless fever
Burning in my brain
Got to keep riding forward
Can't spoil the game
The same way I leave here
Will be the way that I came
Got a restless fever
Burning in my brain

Mr. Policeman
Can you help me find my girl
Last time I saw her
Was at the Magnolia Hotel
If you help me find her
You can be my pal
Mr. Policeman
Can you help me find my girl

Fort Worth or San Antone
Find the bar rooms I got lost in
And send my memories home
Put my tears in a bottle
Screw the top on tight
If you ever go to Houston
You better walk right2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
It Had to Be You,"Why do I do just as you say?
Why must I just give you your way?
Why do I sigh, why don't I try to forget?

It must have been that something lovers call fate
Kept me saying, ""I have to wait""
I saw them all, just couldn't fall 'til we met

It had to be you
It had to be you
I wandered around and finally found the somebody who
Could make me be true, could make me be blue
And even be glad, just to be sad thinking of you

Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross
Or try to be boss
But they wouldn't do

For nobody else gave me a thrill
With all your faults I love you still
It had to be you, wonderful you
It had to be you
For nobody else gave me a thrill
With all your faults I love you still
It had to be you, wonderful you

Where is the one
Who'll change my dream to waking

There's my love
There's my life
In store
The journey's long
Much longer than I reckoned
In any throng
I'll know her in a second
Some lucky day
I'm bound to find her
And when I do

Or it's quiet or it's mad
It's a good thing or it's bad
But beautiful
Beautiful to take a chance and if you fall, you fall
And I'm thinking I wouldn't mind at all
Love is tearful or it's gay
It's a problem or it's play
It's a heartache either way
But beautiful
And I'm thinking if you were mine, I'd never let you go
And that would be but beautiful, I know

Baby I am the king and you're the queen

I don't know why I love her but I just can't stop

You know I love her
Yeah I love her
I'm in love with the Ugliest Girl in the World

If I ever lose her I will go insane
I go half crazy when she calls my name
When she says baby I l-l-love you
There ain't nothing in the world that I wouldn't do


The woman that I love she got two flat feet
Her knees knock together walking down the street
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed
She ain't much to look at but like I said

I don't mean to say that she got nothing going
She got a weird sense of humor that's all her own
When I get low she sets me on my feet
Got a five inch smile but her breath is sweet


The woman that I love she a got a prizefighter nose
Cauliflower ears and a run in her hose
She speaks with a stutter and she walks with a hop

With the roses so red and the lilies so fair
And the myrtle so bright with the emerald hue
The pale and the leader and eyes look like blue
Oh I'll dance, I will sing and my laugh shall be gay
I will charm every heart, in his crown I will sway
When I woke from my dreaming, my idols were clay
All portion of love had all flown away
Oh he taught me to love him and promised to love
And to cherish me over all others above
How my heart is now wondering no misery can tell
He's left me no warning, no words of farewell
Oh, he taught me to love him and called me his flower
That was blooming to cheer him through life's dreary hour
Oh, I long to see him and regret the dark hour
He's gone and neglected this pale wildwood flowerEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Little Sadie,"Went out last night to take a little round
I met my Little Sadie and I brought her down
I ran right home and I went to bed
With a forty-four smokeless under my head

I began to think what a deed I'd done
I grabbed my hat and I began to run
I made a good run but I ran too slow
They overtook me down in Jericho

Standing on a corner a ringing' my bell
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville
He said ""Young man is your name Brown
Remember you blowed Sadie down?""

""Oh yes sir, my name is Lee
I murdered Little Sadie in the first degree
First degree and second degree
If you've got any papers will you serve them to me?""

Well they took me down town and they dressed me in black
They put me on a train and they sent me back
I had no one to go my bail
They crammed me back into the county jail
Oh, yes they did
The judge and the jury they took their stand
The judge had the papers in his right hand
Forty-one days, forty-one nights
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes
Oh, no!

Went out last night to take a little round
I met Little Sadie and I blowed her down
I ran right home and I went to bed
A forty-four smokeless under my headEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland

Gone away is a bluebird
In his place is a new bird
He sings a love song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, ""Are you married?"" We'll say, ""No, man""
But you can do the job when you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kids all knock him down

When it snows, ain't it thrillin'
Though your nose gets a chillin'
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way
Walking in a winter wonderland

When I gave you my love, was it all in vain
All life through, must I go on pretending
Where is my happy ending, where are you

Still saying that paradise once nearly was mineEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

After it brought my love so near
Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny that rainy day is here

Tell me--behind what door your treasure lies
Ever gone broke in a big way
Ever done the opposite of what the experts say

How deep must I go? When do I start?
Do you have any morals
Do you have any point of view

That you brought it all under captivity
And that you really do have all the best intentions

Well I say that you're just young and self-tormented
But that deep down you understand
The hopes and fears and dreams of the discontented

Nor drain a man of his integrity

In the wounded empire of your fool's paradise
With a light above your head forever blinkin'
Turnin' virgins into merchandise
That you must have been beautiful when you were livin'
You remind me of some old-time used-to-be
I say you can be trusted with the power you been given
But you're makin' a liar out of me

To take refuge in your offices of shame
As the earth beneath my feet begins to rumble
And your young men die for nothin' not even fame

And that your conscience not been slain by conformity
That you'll stand up unafraid to believe in justice

From an open window at the end of every hall
Now that you're gone I got to wonder

To some false god of infidelity
And that it's not the Tower of Babel that you're buildin'

Clean Cut Kid,"Everybody wants to know why he couldn’t adjust
Adjust to what, a dream that bust?

He was a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him
That’s what they did

They said what’s up is down, they said what isn’t is
They put ideas in his head he thought were his

He was a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him
That’s what they did

He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band
When he was ten years old he had a watermelon stand

He was a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him
That’s what they did
He went to church on Sunday, he was a Boy Scout
For his friends he would turn his pockets inside out

He was a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him
That’s what they did

They said, “Listen boy, you’re just a pup”
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills
A jeep to drive, blood to spill
They said “Congratulations, you got what it takes”
They sent him back into the rat race without any brakes

He was a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him
That’s what they did

He bought the American dream but it put him in debt
The only game he could play was Russian roulette
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread
Ate Burger Kings, he was well fed
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O’Toole
He stole a Rolls-Royce and drove it in a swimming pool

He was a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him
That’s what they did

He could’ve sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar
Could’ve been an accountant or a tennis star
He was wearing boxing gloves, took a dive one day
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans
They got to sleep together in a home they don’t own

He was a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him
That’s what they did
Well, everybody’s asking why he couldn’t adjust
All he ever wanted was somebody to trust
They took his head and turned it inside out
He never did know what it was all about
He had a steady job, he joined the choir
He never did plan to walk the high wire

He was a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him
That’s what they didEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
The Christmas Blues,"The jingle bells are jingling
The streets are white with snow
The happy crowds are mingling
But there's no one that I know
I'm sure that you'll forgive me
If I don't enthuse
I guess I got the Christmas blues

I've done my window shopping
There's not a store I missed
But what's the use of stoppin'
When there's no one on your list
You'll know the way I'm feeling
When you love and you lose
I guess I've got the Christmas blues

When somebody wants you
Somebody needs you
Christmas is a joy of joys
But friends, when you're lonely
You'll find that it's only
A thing for little girls and little boys
May all your days be merry
Your seasons full of cheer
But till it's January
I'll just go and disappear

Old Santa may have brought you
Some stars for your shoes
But Santa only brought me the blues
Those brightly packaged
Tinsel covered Christmas blues

Naomi Wise,"Well she met him as she promised
Up at Adam's this spring
Expecting some money
Or some other fine thing
No money, no money
To flatter the case
""We'll have to get married
So there'll be no disgrace.""
""So jump you up Omie
And away we will ride
To yonder fair country
Where the cool waters glide.""
She jumped up behind him
And away they did ride
To yonder fair country
Where the deep waters glide
""Now jump you down Omie
And i'll tell you my mind
My mind is to drown you
And to leave you behind.""
She begged and she pleaded
""Oh, don't take my life
And i will deny you
And i'll never be your wife.""
There she kicked and he cuffed her
To the worst understand
And he threw her in deep water
That flows through the land
They found her poor body
The following day
The preacher and the reverend
Lord, they all begun to pray
And up spoke her mother
With a voice so a-sting
""Nobody but John Lewis
Could've done such a thing.""
They traced him up the waters
To Dutch Charlie's Bend
Where they found him in jail
For killin' a man
""Go hang him, go hang him.""
Was that mother's command
""And throw him in deep waters
That flows through the land.""EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

That there really must be somethin' on your mind
Rita May, Rita May
You got your body in the way
You're so damn nonchalant
It's your mind that I want
I'm gonna have to go to college
'Cause you are the book of knowledge Rita MayEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Sentimental Journey,"Gonna take a sentimental journey
Gonna set my heart at ease
Gonna make a sentimental journey
To renew old memories
I got my bag, I got my reservation
Spent each dime I could afford
Like a child in wild anticipation
I long to hear that: ""All aboard!""
Seven, that's the time we leave - at seven
I'll be waiting up for heaven
Counting every mile of railroad track - that moves me back
I never though my heart could be so yearny
Why did I decide to roam
Gotta take a sentimental journey
Sentimental journey home1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
A Fool Such as I,"Now and then there's a fool such as I

Now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I

Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you

Pardon me if I'm sentimental, came to say goodbye

Walls of Red Wing,"Oh, the age of the inmates
I remember quite freely
No younger than twelve
No older ’n seventeen
Thrown in like bandits
And cast off like criminals
All inside the walls
On the grounds of Red Wing

From the dirty old mess hall
You march to the brick wall
Too weary to talk
And too tired to sing
And it’s all afternoon
You remember your hometown
All inside the walls
The walls of Red Wing

Oh, the gates are cast iron
And the walls are barbed wire
Stay far from the fence
With the ’lectricity sting
And it’s keep down your head
And stay in your number
All inside the grounds of
The walls of Red Wing
Oh, it’s fare thee well
To the deep hollow dungeon
Farewell to the boardwalk
That takes you to the screen
And farewell to the minutes
They threaten you with it
All inside the grounds of
The walls of Red Wing

It’s many a guard
That stands around smiling
Holding his club
Like he was a king
Hoping to get you
Behind the wood piling
All inside the grounds of
The walls of Red Wing

The night aimed shadows
Through the crossbar windows
And the wind punched hard
To make the wall-siding sing
It’s many a night
I pretended to be a-sleeping
All inside the grounds of
The walls of Red Wing
As the rain rattled heavy
On the bunkhouse shingles
And the sounds of the night
They made my ears ring
Till the keys of the guards
Clicked the tune of the morning
All inside the grounds of
The walls of Red Wing

Oh, some of us’ll end up
In St. Cloud Prison
And some of us’ll end up
To be lawyers and things
And some of us’ll stand
To meet you on your crossroads
From inside the grounds of
The walls of Red WingEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
This Land Is Your Land,"As I went walking that ribbon of highway
I saw above me that endless skyway
I saw below me that golden valley
This land was made for you and me
This land is your land, this land is my land
From California to the New York Island
From the redwood forest to the gulf stream waters
This land was made for you and me
I've roamed and rambled, and I've followed my footsteps
To the sunny bright sands of her diamond deserts
And all around me a voice came singing
Singing this land was made for you and me
This land is your land, this land is my land
From California to the New York Island
From the redwood forest to the gulf stream waters
This land was made for you and me
It was early one morning as I was strolling
The wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling
As the fog was lifting a voice come chanting
This land was made for you and me
This land is your land, this land is my land
From California to the New York Island
From the redwood forest to the gulf stream waters
This land was made for you and me
Nobody living can ever stop me
As I go walkin' my freedom highway
Nobody living can make me turn back
This land was made for you and me
This land is your land, this land is my land
From California to the New York Island
From the redwood forest to the gulf stream waters

You'll never stray for everyday your Christmas dreams come true

All or Nothing at All,"All or nothing at all
Half a love never appealed to me
If your heart never could yield to me
Then I'd rather have nothing at all

All or nothing at all
If it's love there is no in-between
Why begin then cry for something that might have been
No, I'd rather have nothing at all

Please don't bring your lips so close to my cheek
Don't smile, I'll be lost beyond recall
The kiss in your eyes and the touch of your hand makes me weak
And my heart may grow dizzy and fall

And if I fell under the spell of your call
I would be caught in the undertow
And so you see, I've got to say ""No, no""
All or nothing at all

You Go to My Head,"You go to my head and you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning 'round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne
You go to my head like a sip of sparkling Burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two
The thrill of the thought that you might give a thought to my plea
Cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be
You go to my head with a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand July's
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes
Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my headEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

""And stay all night with me
I have gold chains, and the finest I have
I'll apply them all to thee.""

""I can't get down and I shan't get down
Or stay all night with thee

Kisses she gave him three
With a penny knife that she held in her hand
She murdered mortal he


""Get well, get well, Love Henry, "" She cried
""Get well, get well,"" said she
""Oh don't you see my own heart's blood
Come flowin' down so free?""
She took him by his long yellow hair
And also by his feet
She plunged him into well water, where
It runs both cold and deep

""Lie there, lie there, Love Henry,"" she cried
""'Til the flesh rots off your bones
Some pretty little girl in Cornersville
Will mourn for your return.""


""Hush up, hush up, my parrot,"" she cried
""And light on my right knee
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold
And hung on a willow tree.""

""I won't fly down, I can't fly down
And light on your right knee
A girl who would murder her own true love
Would kill a little birdlike me.""1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
"Long Ago, Far Away","To preach of peace and brotherhood
Oh, what might be the cost!
A man he did it long ago
And they hung him on a cross
Long ago, far away
Those things don’t happen nowadays

The chains of slaves they dragged the ground
With heads and hearts hung low
But it was during Lincoln’s time
And it was long ago
Long ago, far away
Those things like that don’t happen
No more, nowadays, do they

The war guns they bombed and blazed
The whole world bled its blood
Men’s bodies rotted on the ground
As their graves were made in mud
Long ago, far away
Those kind of things don’t happen
No more, nowadays
One man had much money
One man had not enough to eat
One man he lived just like a king
The other man begged on the street
Long ago, far away
Things like that don’t happen
No more, nowadays

One man died of a knife so sharp
One man died from the bullet of a gun
One man died of a broken heart
To see the lynching’ of his son
Long ago, far away
Things like that don’t happen
No more, nowadays

Gladiators killed themselves
It was during the Roman times
People cheered with bloodshot grins
As eyes and minds went blind
Long ago, far away
Things like that don't happen
No more, nowadays
And the talk of peace and brotherhood
Oh, what might be the cost
Man he did it long ago, and hung him on a cross
Long ago, far away
Things like that don't happen
No more, nowadays, do theyEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Solid Rock,"Well, I’m hanging on to a solid rock
Made before the foundation of the world
And I won’t let go, and I can’t let go, won’t let go
And I can’t let go, won’t let go and I can’t let go no more

For me He was chastised, for me He was hated
For me He was rejected by a world that He created
Nations are angry, cursed are some
People are expecting a false peace to come


It’s the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it
Using all the devices under the sun
And He never give up ’til the battle’s lost or won

Final Theme,
Can’t Escape from You,"Oh the evening train is rolling
All along the homeward way
All my hopes are over the horizon
All my dreams have gone away
The hillside darkly shaded
Stars fall from above
All the joys of Earth have faded
The night's untouched, my love
I'll be here 'til tomorrow
Beneath a shroud of gray
I pretend I'm free of sorrow
My heart is miles away
The dead bells are ringing
My train is overdue
To your memory I'm clinging
I can't escape from you
Well I hear the sound of thunder
Roaring loud and long
Sometimes you've got to wonder
God knows I've done no wrong
You've wasted all your power
You threw out the Christmas pie
Now you're withering like a flower
You'll play the fool and die
I'm neither sad nor sorry
I'm all dressed up in black
I fought for fame and glory
You tried to break my back
In the far off sweet forever
The sunshine peeking through
We should have walked together
I can't escape from you
I cannot grasp the shadows
That gather near the door
Rain falls round my window
I wish I'd seen you more
The path is ever winding
The stars they never age
The morning light is blinding
All the world's a stage
Should be the time of gladness
Happy faces everywhere
The mystery of madness
Is propagating in the air
I don't like the city
Not like some folks do
Isn't it a pity
I can't escape from you
We plowed the fields of heaven
Right down to the end
I hope I can be forgiven
If any words of mine offend
All our days were splendid
They were simple, they were plain
It never should have ended
I should have kissed you in the rain
I've been thinking things all over
All the moments full of grace
The primrose and the clover
Your ever changing face
Can't help looking at you
You made love with god-knows-who
Never found a gal to match you
I can't escape from youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Maybe You’ll Be There,"Each time I see a crowd of people
Just like a fool I stop and stare
It's really not the proper thing to do
But maybe you'll be there

I go out walking after midnight
Along the lonely thoroughfare
It's not the time or place to look for you
But maybe you'll be there

You said your arms would always hold me
You said your lips were mine alone to kiss
Now after all those things you told me
How can it end like this

Someday if all my prayers are answered
I'll hear a footstep on the stair
With anxious heart I'll hurry to the door
And maybe you'll be thereEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Watered-Down Love,"Love that’s pure hopes all things
Believes all things, won’t pull no strings
Won’t sneak up into your room, tall, dark and handsome
Capture your soul and hold it for ransom

You don’t want a love that’s pure
You want to drown love
You want a watered-down love

Love that’s pure, it don’t make no false claims
Intercedes for you ’stead of casting you blame
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression
Won’t write it up and make you sign a false confession


Love that’s pure won’t lead you astray
Won’t hold you back, won’t mess up your day
Won’t pervert you, corrupt you with stupid wishes
It don’t make you envious, it don’t make you suspicious

Love that’s pure ain’t no accident
Always on time, is always content
An eternal flame, quietly burning
Never needs to be proud, restlessly yearning

Well, I have had some rotten nights
Didn’t think that they would pass
I’m just thankful and grateful
To be seeing the real you at last

I’m hungry and I’m irritable
And I’m tired of this bag of tricks
At one time there was nothing wrong with me
That you could not fix
Well, I sailed through the storm
Strapped to the mast
But the time has come
And I’m seeing the real you at last

When I met you, baby
You didn’t show no visible scars
You could ride like Annie Oakley
You could shoot like Belle Starr

Well, I don’t mind a reasonable amount of trouble
Trouble always comes to pass
But all I care about now
Is that I’m seeing the real you at last

Well, I’m going to quit this baby talk now
I guess I should have known

I think maybe we’d better leave each other alone

"Tell Ol’ Bill (Alternate Version, North Country Soundtrack)","The river whispers in my ear
I've hardly a penny to my name
The heavens never seemed so near
All of my body glows with flame
The tempest struggles in the air
And to myself alone I sing
It could sink me then and there
I can hear the echoes ring
I tried to find one smiling face
To drive the shadow from my head
I'm stranded in this nameless place
Lying restless in a heavy bed
Tell me straight out if you will
Why must you torture me within?
Why must you come from your high hill?
Throw my fate to the clouds and wind
Far away in a silent land
Secret thoughts are hard to bear
Remember me, you'll understand
Emotions we can never share
You trampled on me as you passed
Left the coldest kiss upon my brow
All of my doubts and fears have gone at last
I've nothing more to tell you now
I walk by tranquil lakes and streams
As each new season's dawn awaits
I lay awake at night with troubled dreams
The enemy is at the gates
Beneath the thunder blasted trees
The words are ringin' off your tongue
The ground is hard in times like these
The stars are cold, the night is young
The rocks are bleak, the trees are bare
Iron clouds go floating by
Snowflakes fallin' in my hair
Beneath the gray and stormy sky
The evenin' sun is sinkin' low
The woods are dark, the town is too
They'll drag you down, they'll run the show
Ain't no telling what they'll do
Tell ol' Bill when he comes home
That anything is worth a try
Tell him that I'm not alone
And that the hour has come to do or die
All the world I would defy
Let me make it plain as day
I look at you now and I sigh
How could it be any other way?1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Rambling Gambling Willie (Studio Outtake),"Come around you roving’ gamblers and a story I will tell
About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well
His name was Will O’Conley and he gambled all his life
He had twenty-seven children, yet he never had a wife
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows

He gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around
Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows

Sailing’ down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans
They’re still talking’ about their card game on that Jackson River Queen
“I’ve come to win some money,” Gambling Willie says
When the game finally ended up, the whole damn boat was his
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek
There was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down
When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole damn town
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows

But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true
He supported all his children and all their mothers too
He wore no rings or fancy things, like other gamblers wore
He spread his money far and wide, to help the sick and the poor
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows

When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
Whether he was bluffing or whether he was true
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair
The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn’t even have a pair
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows
It was late one evening’ during a poker game
A man lost all his money, he said Willie was to blame
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate
When Willie’s cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows

So all you roving’ gamblers, wherever you might be
The moral of the story is very plain to see
Make your money while you can, before you have to stop
For when you pull that dead man’s hand, your gambling days are up
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
Saving Grace,"If you find it in Your heart, can I be forgiven?
Guess I owe You some kind of apology
I’ve escaped death so many times, I know I’m only living
By the saving grace that’s over me

By this time I’d-a thought I would be sleeping
In a pine box for all eternity
My faith keeps me alive, but I still be weeping
For the saving grace that’s over me

Well, the death of life, then come the resurrection
Wherever I am welcome is where I’ll be
I put all my confidence in Him, my sole protection
Is the saving grace that’s over me

Well, the devil’s shining light, it can be most blinding
But to search for love, that ain’t no more than vanity
As I look around this world all that I’m finding
Is the saving grace that’s over me

The wicked know no peace and you just can’t fake it
There’s only one road and it leads to Calvary
It gets discouraging at times, but I know I’ll make it
By the saving grace that’s over meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

With a high sheriff on my trail

High sheriff on my trail, boys

And tell you everything's alright
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long
And not just in the night
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side
Who's a-gonna be your man
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye
And hold your bad luck hand

Hold your bad luck hand, babe
Hold your bad luck hand
Who's a-gonna hold your hard luck hand
And who's a-gonna be your man

Catfish,"Lazy stadium night
Catfish on the mound
“Strike three,” the umpire said
Batter have to go back and sit down

Catfish, million-dollar-man
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can

Used to work on Mr. Finley’s farm
But the old man wouldn’t pay
So he packed his glove and took his arm
And one day he just ran away


Come up where the Yankees are
Dress up in a pinstripe suit
Smoke a custom-made cigar
Wear an alligator boot

Carolina born and bred
Love to hunt the little quail
Got a hundred-acre spread
Got some huntin’ dogs for sale


Reggie Jackson at the plate
Seeing’ nothing’ but the curve
Swing too early or too late
Got to eat what Catfish serve


Even Billy Martin grins
When the Fish is in the game
Every season twenty wins
Gonna make the Hall of Fame

There’s a Flaw in My Flue,"I used to sit by my fireplace
And dream about you
But now that won't do
There's a flaw in my flue
Your lovely face in my fireplace
Was all that I saw
But now it won't draw
My flue has a flaw
From every beautiful ember a memory arose
Now I try to remember and smoke gets in my nose
It's not as sweet by the unit-heat
To dream about you
So darling, adieu
There's a flaw in my flueEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
These Foolish Things,"A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you
A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fairground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you
You came, you saw, you conquered me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone line rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things remind me of you
The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things remind me of youEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
